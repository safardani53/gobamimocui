When considering the price point you're happy to pay, look at whether the wood has been treated to be weather resistant and the quality of the materials used for durability.</p><p>Also, look at what is included with the kitchen as many mud kitchens come with play pots and pans and utensils but for some you would need to purchase these separately.</p><h2>What is the point of a mud kitchen for kids?</h2><p>A mud kitchen allows kids to role-play and have some creative outdoor fun with friends or by themselves. As summer approaches, children love being outside and it means they can have fun with natural materials such as mud, sticks, leaves and stones and use their imaginations to 'cook' with these 'ingredients'.</p><p>Plus, it being in the garden allows kids the freedom to make a mess and it doesn't matter as much as it does inside the house.</p><h2>How much does a mud kitchen cost?</h2><p>We saw a huge variation in costs of mud kitchens so consider how much you want to spend and what you're looking for. This is a substantial toy, usually made from wood, so they don't come cheap - varying from around £50 to £250. You can expect to find a decent quality kids mud kitchen for around £100.</p><h2>How much should I spend on a mud kitchen for kids?</h2><p>How much you spend on a mud kitchen depends on your budget and what features you require in a mud kitchen.</p><p>A decent-sized high-quality wooden mud kitchen will cost you at least £75. But, you can find smaller mud kitchens or ones made of less hardy materials for a cheaper price.</p><p>However, if you want your mud kitchen to last or your kid is particularly fussy about it having a certain amount of fake utensils or an oven, you'll probably want to spend £100 or more.</p><h2>Is a mud kitchen worth the money?</h2><p>This really depends on whether your child likes imaginative play and making a mess! It may be worth investigating how your kids react to this kind of play before making the investment, for example by putting a bowl and utensils in the garden for them initially to see what they do.</p><p>If you're buying your first mud kitchen, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TP toys early fun mud kitchen</a> is a good starting point with a low price point.</p><h2>Where to buy a mud kitchen and accessories?</h2><p>We found a great range of mud play kitchens and accessories at <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a>, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Robert Dyas</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">John Lewis</a>.
