In one case a woman was told 'If you can’t pay me I’ll send some men round when the kids are at school'.</p><p>"She would have sex with men and wouldn’t be paid by them, but her loan amount would go down.&nbsp;</p><p>“In other instances men have told women ‘it would be nice if we were friends’ and encouraged them to send sexual selfies, which they later threaten to use on social media if money isn’t paid.</p><p>“It’s a way of controlling people. Where these men have power and control they will abuse it.”</p><p>Mum-of-five Annie Hawkins told The Sun how a loan shark offered to knock £50 off her debt if she performed a sex act on him.</p><p>Annie, 45, a cleaner from Birmingham, took a £200 loan from a stranger and within weeks owed four times as much.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/200-loan-local-lender-strapped-829502433-1.jpg><p>She said: “He came round and hinted that if I pleasured him he would give me £50 off.</p><p>“He started off flirting, then saying stuff about my body, and then insinuated I could pay off my loan faster, making a rude gesture with his hand, saying ‘you know what to do’.</p><p>“I told him I wasn’t a prostitute and might owe money but wasn’t going to sell myself.
