But the case was not the same before.</p><p>In 2018, the professional UFC fighter was rumored to date <strong>Marcus Buchecha Almeida</strong> and even spotted hanging out at parties. Sadly, they parted ways later that year.</p><p>Before her marriage with Santos, Dern was engaged to her then-fiance, <strong>Augusto Tanquinho Mendes</strong>.</p><p>The two got popular as Jiu-Jitsu couples. However, for some unknown reason, they called off their engagement and parted ways.</p><h2>Mackenzie Dern’s husband, Wesley Santos, gets rough with Coach Juan Gomez.</h2><p>This week, the UFC world was buzzing with a physical altercation between coach <strong>Juan Gomez</strong> and surfer Wesley Santos. Sadly, the striking coach is more worried about his career than his physical injuries.</p><p>Wesley, who is better known as the husband of UFC fighter, Mackenzie Dern, clashed with the coach after Gomez called her and Santos to the Black House gym in Los Angeles.</p><p>Similarly, she believes it was related to monetary compensation regarding her last fight. To clarify, Gomez was right alongside Dern’s father, Wellington, and coach, <strong><a href=#>Bubba Jenkins</a>,</strong> during her win over Hannah Cifers at UFC on ESPN 9 this May.</p><p>When the media approached Gomez, he did not dive into what exactly caused the rift between them but stated how he still has “love” and “respect” for Mackenzie and her husband.</p><h3>“It hurts me when I saw this interview from her speaking about the bonus, which is something that was never my priority. Never. It’s something that people need to know the truth. What happened between me and her husband was nothing about money or bonus. It was numerous factors that built up. It was something not a big deal at all, I thought we flipped the page.”</h3><p>Moreover, he also clarified how he already approached Dern and apologized.</p><h3>“A couple of days ago, I approached her friend, her wrestling coach, that I wanted to say sorry to her. Because in the end I still like her. In the end, I see our friendship. I want the best for her. I wish her the best in this fight.”</h3><p>However, Gomez did state the issue that existed between him and Santos that led to them butting heads.</p><p>Apparently, it all began after Santos began taking more responsibility for Dern’s fights. Even though he does not consider Santos to be “a bad person,” Gomez clearly feels that Santos lacks knowledge regarding the MMA world.</p><h2>What’s up with Mackenzie’s accent?</h2><p>In April 2021, Mackenzie once again gave continuity to her winning tag with a victory against Nina Nunes but people started commenting on her accent, Is it fake or she naturally ends up speaking like this?</p><p>Lety’s get this clear. For people who want to know, Is Mackenzie Dern Brazilian?&nbsp;</p><p>The answer is no. Mackenzie is an American professional mixed martial arts fighter originally from Phoenix, Arizona.</p><p>But yes, this origin of her does not stop grabbing a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and also was previously IBJJF number one ranked female and a two-time BJJ world champion.&nbsp;</p><p>Mackenzie’s father is a famous BJJ black belt Wellington “Megaton” Dias from Rio de Janeiro. And she is married to a professional Brazillian surfer who again speaks Portuguese at home.</p><p>Basically, while Mackenzie is a US netizen, her lineage falls under Brazillian roots. Also, she kept traveling between Brazil and Arizona with her father in her younger days to practice her art.</p><p>Mackenzie was also asked about the accent many times but she took it as a compliment. Moreover, she was amazed to see then fact how people are giving much more attention to her accent than her performance.</p><p>Dern with the UFC reporter <a href=#>Ariel Helwani</a> discussed videos designed by fans that show the evolution of Dern’s accent from quintessential Arizonian to hefty Brazilian drawl. She just laughed off the matter.</p><p>Moreover, a <a href=#>video</a> went viral where she was answering in scouse accent native language to Liverpool again after spending a day in Liverpool.</p><h2>Following the footsteps of UFC Lightweight Champion Conor McGregor</h2><p>After overcoming a battle with former Golden Gloves champion Katherine Roy at LFA 6, on March 10, 2017, grappling wonder Mackenzie Dern has admitted that she is jumping into UFC.</p><p>Mackenzie also disclosed her plans to follow the path of Conor McGregor.</p><p>Reportedly, She has also signed with Paradigm Sports Management which has a number of mixed martial arts’ biggest names linked with it, Conor McGregor, <a href=#>Israel Adesanya</a>, Michael Page, and Cris Cyborg.</p><h2>Net Worth and Income Estimation</h2><p>From what we know, Mackenzie’s income comes from her career as a martial artist.
