deliberately drove his car into a cyclist he "wrongly believed" was responsible for him losing access to his children.</p><p>Mark Whittaker, 46, drove from 65 miles from Portsmouth to Reading last year to "ambush" Darren Fordred and attack him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000486237261-e1556569000132.jpg><p>The court heard Whittaker waited at the victim's house until he saw him set off for work on his bicycle in the early hours of October 12.</p><p>He then rammed his car directly at Mr Fordred in excess of 30mph, throwing him off his bike and on to the windscreen.</p><p>The car then smashed into metal railings, crushing Mr Fordred. His thigh bones snapped in the attack.</p><p>Whittaker, of no fixed abode, then started kicking and punching and strangling him while he screamed: "I lost my wife, I lost my family, I lost everything!"</p><p>The jury was told he wanted to fight Mr Fordred after a domestic row the pair had been involved in over a former partner.</p><p>They heard he thought Mr Fordred was responsible for a series of problems in his life.</p><p>At Reading Crown Court, Judge Heather Norton said: "Your intention in doing so was to confront Darren Fordred, who you wrongly believed was responsible for the loss of your access to your children.</p><p>"It was your intention from the outset to confront him with the use of violence."</p><p>In a pre-sentence report, Judge Norton said it was clear Whittaker had an established pattern of using violence to get even with people he believed had wronged him.</p><p>The judge said Whittaker's intent to kill was clear from threatening messages he had sent to Mr Fordred before the "sustained and violent assault" which was carried out under the influence of alcohol.<br></p><h2>BEHIND BARS</h2><p>Whittaker, who denied attempted murder, was jailed for 21 years and will spend a further three years on licence.</p><p>Michael Roques, prosecuting, told the court Whittaker had 18 previous convictions from 42 offences.</p><p>In a victim impact statement Mr Fordred said: "I have no idea why Mark did what he did but I do know how this has affected me.</p><p>"I am stressed out, in pain all the time, I can’t walk properly and do simple things unaided.</p><p>"It makes me feel old before my time. I think Mark is a coward for using his car as a weapon."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>Investigating officer Detective Constable Peter Cave, of Force CID based at Reading police station, said: "Whittaker’s actions that evening will have a life-long impact on Mr Fordred.</p><p>"This was a horrific and totally unnecessary attack in which Whittaker callously and deliberately used his vehicle as a weapon.</p><p>"This was a pre-meditated attack, given that Whittaker had driven from Portsmouth to confront his victim. He had ample opportunity to reconsider his actions but went ahead with this vicious attack.</p><p>"He knew the dangerous nature of his decision and after the jury rejected his not guilty plea and convicted him of attempted murder, Whittaker repeatedly failed to show any remorse for his actions.</p><p>"I hope the sentence handed down by the court can bring some kind of closure to Mr Fordred and his family. I would like to praise him for his courage throughout this ordeal, and Whittaker will now have a lengthy spell in prison to reflect on the reckless actions he and he alone, decided to take that morning."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000486238022.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000486237729-e1556569020567.jpg><br><p><b>We pay for your stories!
