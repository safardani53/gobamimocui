this year when she launches a comeback just days before turning 55.</p><p>I can reveal <a href=#>the Aussie singer</a> is to unveil the lead single from her 15th studio album later this month, ahead of her big day on May 28.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

worked on the track with top producer Lost Boy, who has previously worked his magic on hits for <a href=#>Ellie Goulding</a>, Becky Hill and Mimi Webb.&nbsp;</p><p>The album will follow this autumn, with a major arena tour being planned for 2024, her first in six years.</p><p>My music insider revealed: “Kylie has finally <a href=#>finished the album</a> and is now raring to go with her return to music.</p><p>“It is being kept under lock and key and hardly anyone at her label has even heard it.</p><p>"The first single will be revealed later this month.</p><p>“It’s classic Kylie and is sure to go down well with her fans.”<br>I told in February how fans would have to wait longer for a new album after Kylie decided to write more songs for it,</p><p>It will be her first since 2020’s Disco, which beat Little Mix to No1 and became the fastest-selling record by a solo act in the UK that year.</p><p>Over the past few weeks, speculation has been rife online that Kylie would follow in the footsteps of <a href=#>Madonna</a> and perform as an interval act at the Eurovision Song Contest in Liverpool next weekend, after Madge did so at Tel Aviv in 2019.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><p>But Kylie fans won’t be so lucky, lucky lucky, as neither she nor any other surprise artist will perform during the final on May 13.</p><p>Despite going through a break-up with <a href=#>Paul Solomons</a>, her partner of five years, during the process of putting the new album together, Kylie is keeping positive on her record.</p><p>I’ve been told it is an upbeat, dance-pop album which will be empowering, rather than dour.</p><p>Sounds good to me</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>SINGLE RYLAN’S FOREIGN POLICY</h2><p>EUROVISION could be the perfect place for Rylan Clark to find a boyfriend – because he needs to meet a foreigner who doesn’t know him.</p><p><a href=#>The Radio 2 host</a>, who is in Liverpool to head the station’s song contest coverage, said lots of potential suitors are intimidated by his celebrity status.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

course I’d love to meet someone.</p><p>"I want the dream of the husband and the kids.</p><p>“I have said for so long that I need someone Italian, Swedish or Spanish.</p><p>“I don’t care who it is, just somebody who hasn’t got a clue.</p><p>"I want to meet someone the old-fashioned way.”</p><p>Rylan, who split from his husband Dan Neal in 2021, had a taste of that last year when he pretended to be someone else for an evening.</p><p>He told the How To Fail podcast: “I went to Barcelona last year on my own and for an entire night, this group of people thought my name was Josh and I was a lawyer, and it was f***ing great.</p><p>“It was amazing until right at the end of the night someone came up to me and went, ‘Oh my God, Rylan, can I have a photo?’.</p><p>"It blew my cover.</p><p>“If you can make me laugh and you’re decent, I don’t care what they look like, hand on heart.</p><p>"My type is gone, because my type doesn’t work for me, clearly. I just want someone nice.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Bizbit</h3></p><p>GEORGE MICHAEL will be posthumously inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame.</p><p>It was revealed yesterday as the 13-strong list of stars was announced in the US.</p><p>Fellow British great Kate Bush will also receive the honour, following the renewed success last year of her hit Running Up That Hill.</p><p>She has had unsuccessful nominations three times previously.</p><p>Other artists in there include Missy Elliott, Willie Nelson, Rage Against The Machine, Sheryl Crow, Chaka Khan and Sir Elton John’s songwriting partner Bernie Taupin.</p><p>The induction ceremony takes place at New York’s Barclays Center on November 3.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>ED SERIES SUMTHING BEAUTIFUL</h2><p>ED SHEERAN feared his four-part Disney+ series The Sum Of It All would be “a propaganda piece” if he edited it himself.</p><p>He gave bosses freedom to use the footage as they wanted, warning it’s an “uncomfortable but beautiful” watch.</p><p><a href=#>Ed</a> attended the premiere, held at the Times Center in New York on Tuesday ahead of <a href=#>yesterday’s release</a>, wearing a black jacket with matching trousers and a white T-shirt.</p><p>He said: “I had loads of footage.</p><p>“I didn’t want it to be a propaganda piece.</p><p>“So I was like, ‘Here is a load of footage and you guys decide what it is and just follow me’.</p><p>“They have made what I think is a really beautiful documentary. It is uncomfortable for me at times to watch but I think people will connect to it.”</p><p>Ed, whose new album Subtract – his sixth studio record – is released tomorrow, added: “The series tackles subjects that everyone goes through.</p><p>“So it’s not like, ‘I’m a famous person, these are famous problems’.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Bizbit</h3></p><p>OLLY MURS has been finessing his stage show while performing across the country and will live- stream the final concert globally.</p><p>In what is being called Best Night Of Your Life, he will stream his show from Manchester’s AO Arena tomorrow, starting at 8.45pm.</p><p><a href=#>Olly</a> has also promised surprises on the night, including a game of Mr & Mrs with his fiancée Amelia Tank before the gig begins.</p><p>You can buy tickets from driift.live to watch at home.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Bizbit</h3></p><p>THERE is no stopping <a href=#>Tom Grennan</a>, who is back with yet another party anthem in time for the summer.</p><p>Last night the singer dropped his latest single, How Does It Feel, as Radio 1’s Hottest Record, after debuting it during a sell-out arena tour in March.</p><p>Tom said: “This song is a reflection of a moment in my life, when I realised I had let something unreal slip.</p><p>“It’s a reflection on the excitement that comes when you know you have a chance to rebuild.</p><p>“It’s exciting, fun and gives you the energy to want to get up and do what you believe in.”</p><p>His 14-track album,What Ifs & Maybes, is out on June 16 and features the song.</p><p>Tom, said: “For this whole album, I’ve definitely made a conscious decision for it to be a record people can just dance to.</p><p>“An album where people can listen in their own time, or fans can come to a show and they can have that sense of escapism.</p><p>“I want them to feel they have no stress and no worries when they’re listening to these songs.</p><p>“So I made that conscious decision to write some up-tempo songs that can live in a party world.</p><p>“How Does It Feel massively does that.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>NICKI'S TIED UP</h2><p>NICKI MINAJ has things all tied up in her new video with Kim Petra.</p><p><a href=#>The rapper</a> features on Kim’s song Alone, and she posed in this red latex shirt while dancing around in the visuals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/please-read-video-grabs-supplied-814543951.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/please-read-video-grabs-supplied-814543933.jpg><p>The clip sees the pair embodying a man’s ultimate fantasies to work out how to get him alone, referencing the title of the song, which came out last month.</p><p>It samples Alice Deejay’s hit Better Off Alone, which reached No2 in 1999.</p><p>They will be hoping this video helps them go one better by topping the charts.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Bizbit</h3></p><p>Sir Elton John, Guns N’ Roses, Lizzo and Arctic Monkeys&nbsp;are joined by an unlikely name on the Glastonbury line-up – Joe Wicks.</p><p>The fitness guru has been announced as a performer at next month’s festival in Somerset, where he will take to the stage in the theatre and circus fields.</p><p>Joe, who kept the nation fit during lockdown, has been on tour playing upbeat music and getting people moving.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>KAREN’S COSMIC OUTFIT</h2><p>KAREN GILLAN looks out of this world on her latest leg of film screenings.</p><p>She wore this black split skirt to a Florida showing of new movie Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3, in which she stars as Nebula.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/karen-gillan-attends-guardians-galaxy-814466033.jpg><p>But it’s unlikely she will be whizzing around the universe in the Tardis again, having played Amy Pond in Doctor Who from 2010 to 2013.</p><p>Asked about a potential return to the BBC series, <a href=#>the Scottish actress</a> told Radio Times: “It’s always nice when people appreciate anything that you’ve done.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"But no, it’s cool to see that people are still intrigued by Amy Pond and whether she could return.
