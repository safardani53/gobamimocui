Despite some controversy along the way, the “Last Night” singer, 30, has climbed the charts and been a crossover success. His albums&nbsp;Dangerous: The Double Album&nbsp;and&nbsp;One Thing at a Time&nbsp;both landed at the top of the&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;charts, and his single “Last Night” hit number one on the Hot 100 chart.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>While Morgan is primarily a country singer, he’s collaborated with quite a few rappers. He has released a few songs where he’s shared the track with&nbsp;<strong>Lil Durk.&nbsp;</strong>Most recently, he was featured in&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Drake’s</a>&nbsp;</strong>new music video for <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“You Broke My Heart,”</a> which was released on Wednesday, December 20, 2023. The video began with the two of them having a drink in a fancy restaurant and discussing a woman. The two of them then hop into Drake’s car and drive off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/who-is-morgan-wallen-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Here’s what else you need to know about Morgan:</p><h2>It Took 2 Years for His Debut Album to Top the Charts</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>His first studio LP If I Know Me dropped on April 27, 2018. He had already <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>opened for the superstar country duo</a> &nbsp;<strong>Florida Georgia Line</strong> during their 2017 tour, and FGL appeared on the album’s second single, “Up Down.” Morgan’s third single “Whiskey Glasses” was released in the summer of 2018, and it was a slow burn hit, reaching number one on the country radio airplay charts in June 2019 and becoming one of the year’s biggest hits. If I Know Me finally finally reached the number one spot on the Billboard Country Album chart in August 2020, 114 weeks after it was released.</p><h2>Morgan was Cut from a 2020 ‘SNL’ Episode for Breaking COVID Quarantine</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Morgan broke strict <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>quarantine rules</a> in place by&nbsp;SNL&nbsp;due to COVID-19, and was seen in several TikTok videos at partying hard in Tuscaloosa, AL following the University of Alabama’s football game the previous Saturday. In the videos, Morgan was at a bar and a house party taking shots, not social distancing, not wearing a mask, and kissing female fans.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>On October 7, the then-27-year-old shared an Instagram video from his New York hotel room, revealing he was getting ready for his Saturday performance, “and I got a call from the show that I will no longer be able to play. And that’s because of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>COVID protocols</a>, which I understand.” Morgan noted that he has <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tested negative</a> for the coronavirus, but that his actions the weekend prior were “pretty short sighted, and they’ve obviously affected by long term goals and my dreams.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Two months after he was originally supposed to perform on Saturday Night Live, Morgan appeared on the show as the musical guest. The singer previously apologized for putting the cast and crew “in jeopardy” by partying maskless and not social distancing, pledging to “work” on himself and take responsibility. Morgan performed two of his hits, “7 Summers” and “Still Goin’ Down” during the <strong>Jason Bateman</strong>-hosted episode. He also <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>appeared in a sketch</a> making fun of his partying scandal.</p><h2>Morgan Was a Contestant on ‘The Voice’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>The singer appeared on 2014’s season six of the music competition. Surprisingly the Tennessee-born country singer wasn’t on Team <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a>, as he was initially with coach <strong>Usher</strong> and then Team <strong>Adam Levine</strong> before being eliminated in the playoff rounds.</p><h2>Morgan Is a Father</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>He welcomed son <strong>Indie Wilder</strong> in July with ex-fiancée<strong> Katie Smith</strong>. Morgan shared an <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram photo</a> cradling his little boy on July 1, writing, “<span>Little Wilder, I’m a changed man. I see mine differently now. It’s not just me anymore, and I’m glad it’s not. This year has been the hardest of my life in so many ways, but that’s not what i will remember it by. You are.”</span></p><h2>Morgan Was Involved in More Controversy When He Was Heard Using a Racial Slur</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11>The “Wasted on You” singer was heard hurling the slur while heading into his Tennessee home. A video obtained by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a> shows Morgan and his friends arriving at the house around midnight and making a ton of noise. Neighbors came outside, and one began recording the incident.</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Morgan is heard telling someone to watch over one of the other guys in their group. Among other profanities, the country singer says, “take care of this p****-ass n*****.” On February 10, 2021 he posted a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>lengthy video</a> apology to clarify some of his comments. “The video you saw of me was me on hour 72 of 72 of a bender and that’s not something I’m proud of either.” he explained, confessing he was “nervous” as he filmed the Instagram post. “I let so many people down…I’m not OK with that…I also accepted some invitations from some amazing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Black organizations</a>, executives and leaders to engage in some real and honest conversations,” he went on. “Our actions matter, our words matter, and I just want to encourage anyone watching to please learn from my mistakes. There is no reason to downplay what I did. It matters,” he shared.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>Days before the video, he also apologized via a statement: “I’m embarrassed and sorry,” he said on February 5, 2021. “I used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back. There are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologize for using the word. I promise to do better.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2K6sL7GmqVmr5Ghuaa6jJymrqakp8Zuv8innp6qXWl%2Fc3yVb2lo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./andrew-santinos-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Andrew Santino's Net Worth And How He Earned It</a>
