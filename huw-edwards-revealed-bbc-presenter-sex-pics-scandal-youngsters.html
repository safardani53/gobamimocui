61,</a> faced more <a href=#>allegations of inappropriate be­haviour</a> — this time towards his junior TV colleagues.</p><p>It later emerged that three employees had complained about him, with one claiming they were sent messages that left them feeling “uncomfortable”, citing an “abuse of power”.</p><p>The <a href=#>BBC</a> confirmed that it was pressing ahead with an investigation into serious allegations against the star, including payment of thousands of pounds to a vulnerable youngster with a spiralling drug addiction.</p><p>The decision came after police said yesterday they had found no evidence Mr Edwards had committed a criminal offence.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read more on BBC scandal ">Read more on BBC scandal</h2><p>Amid on-air confusion, <a href=#>BBC</a> news anchor <a href=#>Sophie Raworth</a> mistakenly announced Mr Edwards had resigned — only to retract the statement minutes later.</p><p>She told viewers: “Huw Edwards is the presenter accused of paying a teenager for explicit photos. In the last few minutes he has announced his resignation.</p><p>“Tonight there are yet more allegations, though, of inappropriate behaviour by the presenter — this time towards BBC colleagues.</p><p>“The corporation said it’s resuming its own investigation.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>Moments before the Six O’Clock News came on air, BBC presenter <a href=#>Victoria Derbyshire</a> tweeted that Mr Edwards was “facing further allegations this evening of inappropriate conduct being reported by BBC News & #Newsnight”.</p><p>In her statement, Mrs Flind said her husband was now receiving “in-patient hospital care” after suffering a “serious episode”.</p><p>She told how it had been “five extremely difficult days for our family”.</p><p>Mrs Flind wrote of her husband: “I am doing this primarily out of concern for his mental wellbeing and to protect our children. Huw is suffering from serious mental health issues.</p><p>“As is well documented, he has been treated for severe depression in recent years.</p><p>“The events of the last few days have greatly worsened matters. He has suffered another serious episode and is now receiving in­patient hospital care where he’ll stay for the foreseeable future.”</p><p>Mrs Flind said the father of five would respond to the claims “once well enough to do so”.</p><p>The statement followed pressure for the presenter to name himself, with fellow BBC stars being wrongly accused on <a href=#>social media</a>.</p><p>Mrs Flind added: “I know Huw is deeply sorry that so many colleagues have been impacted by the recent media speculation.</p><p>“We hope this statement will bring that to an end.”</p><p>The bombshell statement dropped minutes after the <a href=#>Met Police</a> announced it was taking “no further action” over the presenter’s conduct, concluding that no “criminal offence has been committed”.</p><p>The longer he leaves it, the worse it will be for him.</p><span class=quote-credit>Jeremy Vine</span><p>It said: “Detectives from the Met’s Specialist Crime Command have now concluded their assessment and have determined there is no information to indicate a criminal offence has been committed.”</p><p>The BBC immediately said it would re-commence its own non-criminal investigation into the ­suspended star.</p><p>On Tuesday, The Sun revealed two new cases of alleged inappropriate behaviour by Mr Edwards.</p><p>The BBC itself revealed a person in their 20s had been sent abusive and menacing messages by the newsreader.</p><p>Fellow BBC star <a href=#>Jeremy Vine</a> said yesterday that the presenter needed to come forward before more damage was done.</p><p>Speaking on his C5 show before Mrs Flind’s statement, Mr Vine, 58, said the allegations had reached a “dangerous point” for the star, adding: “The longer he leaves it, the worse it will be for him.”</p><p>It emerged yesterday that newsreader Mr Edwards had told pals he is “extremely angry” about the situation.</p><p>But Mr Vine insisted the star had to name himself, even if he is sacked by the Beeb.</p><p>Once well enough to do so, Huw intends to respond to the stories.</p><span class=quote-credit>Vicky Flind, Huw Edwards' wife</span><p>He said: “The idea that he could just remain anonymous forever, and then walk back into the building with his ID pass? Oh no, that’s not going to happen.”</p><p>Mr Vine — who along with BBC celebs including <a href=#>Gary Lineker, Nicky Campbell and Rylan Clark</a> had publicly denied being the unnamed star — said his colleague “will have to answer” claims against him.</p><p>He said: “He must have a defence, he must have one. Maybe he’s going to say it’s all a misunderstanding?”</p><p>However the TV and radio star insisted it was possible for the newsreader to “fight back”.</p><p>He added: “I haven’t spoken to him but I gather from somebody who has that he is described as angry and keen to play it long. Now to me, that means that he wants to be anonymous for as long as possible, hoping that he can one day walk back into the building.”</p><p>News of Mr Edwards’ involvement came after four young people — including one interviewed by BBC News — had made serious allegations about his behaviour.</p><p>Yesterday The Sun revealed the BBC star stood accused of breaking the law by defying the third national lockdown to meet a young stranger from a dating site.</p><p>The Sun has further evidence about the actions of the news anchor which will be handed to BBC investigators.</p><p>I want to reassure you that our immediate concern is our duty of care to all involved.</p><span class=quote-credit>Tim Davie, Director-General of the BBC</span><p>Meanwhile, he was last night facing further claims from junior BBC colleagues that he sent them unwanted and “flirtatious” messages on social media.</p><p>The BBC’s special correspondent Lucy Manning said a current employee received “inappropriate” messages this year.</p><p>No formal complaint had been made because they want to remain anonymous, but they are said to be “considering” it.</p><p>Ms Manning claimed “another BBC worker and a former one” had also contacted Newsnight.</p><p>She revealed: “A current BBC employee said this year they had received suggestive messages on social media from the presenter.</p><p>"They believe the messages were inappropriate, especially as the presenter was a much more senior colleague. BBC News has seen the messages which refer to the BBC staff member’s appearance and they are flirtatious.</p><p>“The BBC employee wants managers to be more proactive specifically towards younger staff who work with the presenter and to address how senior and junior members of staff interact.</p><p>“They haven’t yet put in a formal complaint because of a desire to remain anonymous but might ­consider it.”</p><p>She added: “Another BBC worker and a former one have also told Newsnight they received what they perceived to be more inappropriate social media messages from the presenter that made them feel uncomfortable.</p><p>“One said they felt it was an abuse of power by someone very senior in the organisation.</p><p>“There has been no response from the presenter’s lawyers.”</p><p>Mr Edwards is one of the corporation’s most high-profile newsreaders, with a salary of over £430,000.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>'Abuse of power'</h2><p>He has presented the flagship BBC News at Ten programme for more than a decade, and continued to report more than a dozen times since the first claims against him were reported to the corporation on May 19.</p><p>In relation to the latest claims, a BBC spokesman said: “We are communicating with staff and will continue to do so.</p><p>“We always treat the concerns of staff with care, and would always urge any staff members to speak to us if they have any concerns.</p><p>“We have clear processes for making complaints within the organisation, including whistle­blowing procedures should someone wish to do so anonymously.”</p><p>David Sillito, BBC Media and Arts Correspondent, said on the BBC News channel: “There has been one story after the other. It began with a story about allegations of sexually explicit photos. A young person who was said to have been paid £35,000.</p><p>“Further revelations today about what seemed to be certainly inappropriate messages, the allegations that these are inappropriate messages to people within the building.</p><p>“All of this has added beyond the initial allegations that there are questions to be answered.”</p><p>The BBC’s director-general Tim Davie later sent an email to staff, reassuring them “that our immediate concern is our duty of care to all involved.”</p><p>He said this will “no doubt be a difficult time for many after a challenging few days”.</p><p>He added: “The Metropolitan Police and South Wales Police confirmed they would be taking no further action following an assessment of information provided to them.</p><p>“As you know, we were asked to pause our fact-finding investigations until that assessment had been concluded. It is important we now continue with this work.</p><p>“I want to be clear that in doing so we will follow due process.</p><p>“This remains a very complex set of circumstances. As we’ve done throughout, our aim must be to navigate through this with care and consideration in line with the BBC values.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Star announced death of Queen</h3></p><p>By Oliver Harvey</p><p>HUW Edwards is the trusted face of the BBC who has guided the nation through many defining moments.</p><p>When Queen Elizabeth died last year he had just ten seconds to prepare to break the news to millions.</p><p>From her funeral to King Charles’ Coronation and the 2019 General Election, he has been the onscreen epitome of dignity and calm authority.</p><p>Church-going dad-of-five Huw took over from David Dimbleby as the BBC’s anchorman on state occasions.</p><p>His lilting Welsh brogue provided sparse yet compelling commentary at occasions as solemn as Prince Philip’s funeral and as joyous as the Prince and Princess of Wales’ 2011 wedding.</p><p>Huw commands a salary of at least £435,000 — making him BBC News’ highest-paid presenter.</p><p>His dazzling career began with a short stint at local station Swansea Sound.</p><p>He then joined the BBC’s News department as a trainee.
