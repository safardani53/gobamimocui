described as inspiring.</strong></p><p>The all-weather at Lingfield or Chelmsford would struggle to get the blood pumping of the most fervent racing fan.</p><p>But to Rab Havlin it will feel like Royal Ascot.</p><p>He has been counting down to the most ordinary of race days after a hellish ten months riddled with injustice and frustration.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pa-11136971jpg-js4775796.jpg><p>It will be the first time he has ridden in a race since January after French authorities banned him for failing a drug test.</p><p>It’s an allegation he fiercely denies — and tests prove he could not be guilty of. His boss John Gosden describes it as an “appalling miscarriage of justice”.</p><p>Havlin is continuing the fight to clear his name in the French courts. He estimates the whole episode has cost him more than £100,000 and several Group-race prizes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/racing-york-152692jpg-js347527682.jpg><p>Havlin told me: “It feels like I’ve been thrown under a bus. It’s been kick in balls after kick in the balls.</p><p>“I read something the other day I thought was good — ‘if you’re walking through hell don’t stop, keep walking. That’s how I feel.”</p><p>It’s hard to blame him.</p><p>Life was good for Havlin last year. His 82 winners was a personal best. It included a first Royal Ascot success, three Group-race victories and becoming a key member of Gosden’s powerful team.</p><p>He had just married Kelly, mother of his two young daughters, and they were thinking of moving house. Then his world was turned upside down.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Enable the one to beat</h3></p><p><strong>RED-HOT Arc favourite Enable has “no chinks in her armour” says Rab Havlin.</strong></p><p>And he should know. Havlin has been riding John Gosden’s fantastic filly every day ahead of tomorrow’s big race.</p><p>He rode Enable to her debut win in November. This time he will be cheering her on at Chantilly as the dual Oaks heroine looks to extend her run of Group 1 wins to five.</p><p>He said: “I’ve been riding Enable a lot recently, either me or Frankie ride her work. I led Frankie in her last piece of work the other day. He said ‘you can feel her lungs — she must have the lungs of an elephant’.</p><p>“There’s no chinks in her armour. Everything has to improve to beat her. She’s the best filly we’ve had and we’ve had some good ones.”</p><p>After riding Arc favourite <strong>Enable</strong> to a debut success at Newcastle in November, just a few days short of his 43rd birthday, a letter arrived that filled him with horror.</p><p>It was from France Galop. Although the Scot is far from fluent in French, the words ‘cocaine’ and ‘morphine’ were only too clear.</p><p>A translation revealed the crushing news he had failed a drugs test when riding in France in October and was facing a six-month ban.</p><p>Havlin said: “I couldn’t believe it. The letter said I’d tested positive for five substances. I thought ‘this must be someone else’s test – they’ve messed this up’.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sportsfile_1353367jpg-js339070954-e1500892861661.jpg><p>Two of the substances could be accounted for. Havlin had taken some pills before riding at Saint-Cloud after injuring his back.</p><p>Guidelines suggested that medication should have cleared his body but the presence of cocaine and morphine was a much bigger worry.</p><p>The months that followed would have tested anyone’s belief in justice. Havlin said: “I’ve never regretted fighting it. I wouldn’t be able to look the kids in the eye if I hadn’t.</p><p>“The second half of the year has been frustrating. For the first half I kept thinking someone was going to step in and say ‘this is absolute b*****ks’.</p><p>“I always had another hearing to aim at. Leaving every hearing my lawyer and I were like ‘that went well, hopefully this will be the end of it’. And then you find out that nothing has changed.”</p><p>In a criminal court a plating-class barrister would be able to tear the case apart in a lunch break. But sporting authorities play by their own rules.</p><p>The paperwork on the original urine test had not been signed, neither had the equipment used in the test.</p><p>The B-sample was only tested for one of the five substances so it was impossible to say if it matched the original.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Templegate's TV tips</h3></p><img alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/betnew-11.jpg><p>Havlin paid to have a hair sample tested meticulously to prove he had nothing to hide.</p><p>That proved beyond doubt he had not taken cocaine or morphine. But France Galop chose to ignore the evidence.</p><p>In his 27 years as a jockey, Havlin, who grew up near Ayr in the west of Scotland, has never failed any of the regular tests in Britain.</p><p>He has not even registered on the breathalyser when checked for alcohol.</p><p>With the choking smoke of a drugs ban wafting across Havlin’s character it would be easy for some to presume there had to be some fire. But there doesn’t seem to be even a smoulder of suspicion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/betnew-11.jpg><p>Gosden has never doubted Havlin’s innocence. He said: “It’s been an appalling miscarriage of justice. There’s obviously been contamination along the way. The whole process has been most unsatisfactory.</p><p>“If for one moment I thought he was guilty I would tell him to do his time and shut up. I know he’s completely innocent.</p><p>“He was riding for me the night before and my wife and I travelled with him to France early in the morning. They want to sweep it under the carpet, the jockey will be suspended and he’ll give up.</p><p>We’re not going to give up — we’re determined to see justice done. Robert’s a very honourable man, a good bloke and I’m backing him all the way.”</p><p>That support is not lost on Havlin.</p><p>He said: “The boss has been unbelievable. Right from the very start he said to me ‘you’re coming in, getting stuck in here — you’re coming racing with me, I don’t want you sitting at home watching other people winning on these horses’.</p><p>“So I’ve been going racing with him. We’re using a lot of jockeys who wouldn’t know the horses so I’ve been speaking to them.</p><p>"I’ve enjoyed that. It’s been good to see another side. It will make me a better rider.</p><p>“When I have bad days I just take myself off on the bike. That’s when I get angry about it the most.</p><p>“It could have been a hell of a lot worse. I’ve been saving up to move house. We were so lucky we didn’t because we’d have probably lost it by now.”</p><p>Even the darkest cloud can have a silver lining. The break has made Havlin appreciate what he has missed out on.</p><p>He added: “Normally when I get up in the morning to ride out the kids are in bed and when I come back at night they’re in bed. You’re a Facetime dad.</p><p>“That will be the hard bit. I’ve got all my jobs now, all the school runs, the ponies, ballet, gymnastics. I don’t know how Kelly is going to cope.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZLWwvtKeqZqbmaO0cICUcHBpaWNkv6KujKGYr6SZo3q0vMSaoqxlla2wrcHSoq2epKliwbB50q2cr51dn7yvsdJmmJunpal6qbXSZpurrZdir6K6jJqlnWWknbJutMSlo6KrmGLBprqMpqanrJioerW0wK1kn6ecoby4scNo</p></div><div id=links><a href=./carrie-underwood-hates-homewrecker-leann-rimes-source-claims.html>&#171;&nbsp;Carrie Underwood Hates &amp;quot;Homewrecker&amp;quot; LeAnn Rimes, Source Claims</a>
