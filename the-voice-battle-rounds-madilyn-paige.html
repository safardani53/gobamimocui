So who had a happy ending? <strong>Josh</strong>! The&nbsp;family man who surprised the judges as one of the best singers early on, is sticking around!</p><p id=content-paragraph-3><strong>Alaska & Madi</strong>, the best friends and country duo, went up against soloist <strong>Audra McLaughlin</strong> who proved she had the pipes to stand up to the two girls. Two against one hardly seems fair, but&nbsp;<strong>Audra</strong> proved that her one perfect voice was powerful enough to secure her spot on Team Blake. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Blake Shelton</strong></a> was deeply “agonizing” over the decision, alongside the other three judges who agreed this was one of the toughest decisions ever, but he was proud to keep Audra on his team for good!</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Next up? 16-year old <strong>Deja Hall</strong> versus mother of one <strong>Music Box</strong>. These soulful ladies took the spotlight with a near pitch-perfect version of “Eternal Flame,” but the audience was blown away by little Deja’s big voice. <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Shakira</strong></a> was taken aback, too&nbsp;— she nabbed Deja Hall for the long haul (pun intended)! But seriously, this is the year of the supreme teens!</p><h3>Are Madilyn Paige and Tanner James Dating?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-5><a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Usher</strong></a> mentored two of his teenagers next. Yep, more talented teens!&nbsp;<strong>Madilyn Paige</strong>, who is the youngest competitor on the show, went to battle with&nbsp;<strong>Tanner James</strong>, but these two were so darn cute that it looked more like a lovers’ quarrel than a cutthroat competition!&nbsp;“I call this the Romeo & Juliet battle,” said <strong>Usher</strong>, during rehearsals. “Two teenagers passionately challenging each other.” They even attend the same high school and serendipitously both landed on The Voice!&nbsp;What are the chances?</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Only one singer could stay in the competition and that ended up being <strong>Madilyn</strong>, but we think these two should date. Or duet. Whatever they’d like. Even host <strong>Carson Daly</strong> said that their love song of <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>‘s “Everything Has Changed” — did you see them gaze into each other’s eyes at the end of their performance? — was reminiscent to The Notebook&nbsp;and <strong>Adam</strong> compared the performance to puppies running through a field. Adorable.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Just when we thought that&nbsp;Tanner might be stolen by <strong>Shakira</strong>, the&nbsp;lover boy was sent home, but he held his head up high. Shakira did call him out for being romantic so we hope that him and Madilyn somehow keep in touch! Maybe Tanner will support Madilyn and show up in the audience during the live shows?! (We can only dream — this is all wishful thinking, in the name of young love.)</p><h3>Shakira Goes In For The Steal</h3><p id=content-paragraph-8>Next up was&nbsp;real-life couple and indie duo, <strong>Dawn & Hawkes</strong>, who battled it out with Texan dad <strong>Josh Murley</strong>. All three contestants took their instruments to the stage and we loved this musical performance of “Stuck In The Middle With You.” The judges loved it, too! <strong>Dawn & Hawkes</strong> ended up landing on Team Adam, but this battle was so impressive that Josh&nbsp;also made it through.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Shakira stole Josh at the last second, pointing out that his performance made her want to grab a beer with him. We’ll cheer to that!</p><h3>Frontrunner Bria Kelly Heads Into Battle&nbsp;— Is She Safe?</h3><p id=content-paragraph-10>Frontrunner <strong>Bria Kelly</strong>, who stole the hearts of all four judges and viewers in the very first episode of&nbsp;The Voice‘s sixth season&nbsp;went head-to-head with NFL cheerleader&nbsp;<strong>Tess Boyer</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>Janis Joplin</strong>‘s “Piece Of My Heart.” Going into the toughest battle of the night,&nbsp;<strong>Bria</strong><i>&nbsp;</i>was highly favored to come out on top, but this was an epic showdown!&nbsp;<strong>Tess</strong> brought her A-game, even throwing off the judges.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Shakira said that Tess was more dynamic than Bria. Adam said that he has a soft spot for Bria, yet is now a fan of Tess. However, he said that he’s afraid of Team Usher because of Bria’s presence alone! But <strong>Blake</strong> actually thought that Tess was the top runner, and even shocked himself by uttering those words. Usher, who had to make the decision, said that “something special happened” to Tess. He was so impressed that she rocked the house! But was he still overwhelmed by Bria’s big voice?</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Yes, he was! Bria made it on Team Usher! (Sorry, Adam.)</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>But, not to worry, Tess&nbsp;— you are now on Team Blake! “She just blew me away with that performance,” said Tess’s new coach Blake.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>“She was the underdog, and she surprised us all,” said Shakira.</p><p id=content-paragraph-15><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, what was your favorite performance of the night? Did you love Madilyn and Tanner’s duet?</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>On another note,&nbsp;NBC’s “The Voice” — the Emmy Award–winning singing competition series and No. 1 reality show — has had us all imagining the chance of hanging out with superstar coaches Adam Levine, Shakira, Blake Shelton and Usher. How great it would be to spend time with them as well as go behind the scenes with those folks who help shape the style and look of the competitors. Now, for the first time, long-running entertainment news magazine “Extra” is teaming up with “The Voice” to send one singer to “Extra’s ‘The Voice’ Bootcamp Experience.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-17><strong>Here’s how it works:</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-18>Beginning Monday, March 24, 2014, “Extra” will host an extensive talent search to give one singer an exclusive opportunity for a vocal lesson with “The Voice” vocal coach Trelawny Rose, a makeover with “The Voice” stylists, and a one-on-one audition with “The Voice” casting director.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Viewers interested in competing will have the chance to audition online at Extratv.com/thevoice until midnight Friday, April 18.</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>The top contestants will be chosen and, after an online voting period, 11 finalists will visit “Extra” at Universal Studios Hollywood to sing for hosts Mario Lopez and Maria Menounos.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>After performing for Mario and Maria, the “Extra” hosts will choose one lucky person to go through “Extra’s ‘The Voice’ Bootcamp Experience.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>The winner will also receive two tickets to “The Voice” finale and be featured on “Extra.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-23>For more information or to submit an audition online, visit Extratv.com/thevoice. “Extra” airs weeknights (check local listings) and “The Voice” airs Mondays and Tuesday at 8/7c on NBC.</p><p id=content-paragraph-24><strong>—&nbsp;Elizabeth Wagmeister</strong></p><p id=content-paragraph-25><a class=twitter-follow-button href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Follow @EWagmeister</a></p><h3>More ‘The Voice’ News:</h3><li>‘The Voice’ Battle Rounds: Meet The Four Female Frontrunners</li><li>‘The Voice’: Adam Steals Standout Singer From Shakira In Battle Rounds</li><li>‘The Voice’ Battle Rounds Begin: Sisaundra Lewis Steals The Show</li><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlkZH10e5FtZq2glWLDsLXCnmSbmaSpuaZ50aisp5yjYrqisMilsKdloJa2qLGO</p></div><div id=links><a href=./salma-hayek-parents.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Are Salma Hayeks Parents?
