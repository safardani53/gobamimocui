called a family member and said, ‘Come and get me, I can’t get home’, someone would come and pick you up.</p><p>“If you’re drunk, if you’ve had a few drinks, you’re so vulnerable, your guard is down, you just wanna get home, and I think a lot of young girls put themselves in that situation, and if I think if you are in that situation, just call somebody. Don’t get in a cab, don’t get on a train – you can get attacked on a train.”</p><p>Kaye Adams pointed out that Kelly’s brother is training to be a taxi driver –so has undergone strict background checks, and asked, “Wouldn’t you trust him?”</p><p>To which Kelly responded: “Well I wouldn’t go out and get silly drunk.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/k2.png><p>“Well you have to trust people?” persisted Kaye, as Kelly said, “Well obviously not, no.”</p><p>Kelly went on to state that young women should just phone someone they can trust if they are “vulnerable” on their way home late at night.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/k5.png><p>She said: “I think there are a lot of abuser taxi drivers who have done this.</p><p>“You’re in a very vulnerable state, it’s late at night, it’s not just taxi drivers, it can be someone else on a night out, you are vulnerable.</p><p>“You are a young woman, it’s late at night, call someone you can trust and can give you advice on how to get home, I think that’s the best thing to do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/k4.png><p>Despite Kelly seemingly having good intentions and never actually blaming rape victims, viewers were furious with her standpoint.</p><p>One wrote: “@loosewomen Someone please educate Kelly Brook about rape myths, including drink, trust, vulnerability, reporting etc. #LooseWomen Thank goodness for Kaye Adams.”</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Rapist John Worboys who preyed on women by posing as a taxi driver is released from prison after serving 10 years</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000019123719.jpg><p>A second said: “Kelly Brook might as well have said those women deserved to be sexually assaulted!

You seemed to blame the victims. Hope it never happens to you!”</p><p>Another pointed out: “Kelly Brook saying she wouldn’t go out and get silly drunk? Well okay but it shouldn’t really matter 🤷🏻♀ #LooseWomen”</p><p>And a fifth tweeted: “#LooseWomen I'm so over this notion that women must alter their behaviour and not do xyz to prevent them from being assaulted.

Black cab rapist John ­Worboys, 60, will have served less than nine years for attacks on 12 women.</p><p>In 2009, he was convicted of 19 offences and ordered to serve at least eight years in jail - but campaign groups have since lashed out at the Parole Board's decision to allow him to walk free by the end of the month.</p><p><strong>Got a story?</strong> email <a href=#>digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk</a> or call us direct on 02077824220.</p><p><strong>We pay for videos too</strong>.
