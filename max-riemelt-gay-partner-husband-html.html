Did he introduce his gay partner or was it just another&nbsp;movie role as gay?&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Max Riemelt is widely known internationally for playing the role of Wolfgang Bogdanow in the Netflix series, Sense8.

His talent got recognized quickly as he was cast as a leading character as the Waisenkind ‘Max Loser’ in the ZDF Christmas series Zwei Allein that was directed by Matthias Steurer.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Sunny Anderson, Getting Married With Husband Is Choice - Dating And Boyfriend Enough For Now</a></p><p>The 38-year-old actor soon made his music video cameo appearance in Two of a Kind by the Hamburg duo “R & B.” His profession soon led him to star in Dennis Gansel’s feature film, Girls on Top in 2001.</p><p>It was in 2013 when he starred in the movie, Free Fall alongside Hanno Koffler where he plays the role of a gay police officer Kay Engel.

The series had its first season showered with positive reviews from the critics.</p><h2><strong>Max Plunges Into Gay Rumors with Supposed Partner</strong></h2><p>Many people assume Max is gay due to various reasons; one of them comes with his gay role in the German drama movie, Free Fall. And Max has not bothered to clear the assumptions as well.</p><p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Tempestt Bledsoe On Getting Married And Having Husband; Redefine Relationship - Then And Now</a></p><p>So the movie follows his love story with his gay partner, Marc Borgmann which is played by Hanno Koffler as Marc struggles to maintain his relationship with his pregnant girlfriend and the affair he develops with Kay Engel, that is played by Max Riemelt.</p><p>That was the first reason why fans were questioning Max being gay. Oh, and you have to get a bite of this incident that led people to confirm that Max was gay.</p><p>Well, Max was seen kissing his co-star Brian J Smith, who plays Will Gorski in Sense8 in Brazil. And if that wasn’t enough, Max had quite an interesting response to the incident as he said,</p><p>It just happened… It was all like in a dream and it felt so good… people like to see us making out together and we thought it would just be a nice treat for them.</p><p>Oh and we believe you Max; not the thing about giving the fans a nice treat, but the fact that you confessed that it felt like a dream. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Well, that pretty much confirms that Max is a gay; he could be a bi-sexual as well, but no one knows. But Max has refrained from opening up too much about his dating life or his possible&nbsp;mystery husband. That may be because he doesn’t have a partner or because his partner likes to stay in the shadows.</p><p>Anyway, Max hasn’t dropped a single hint on his dating status, but he has mentioned having a daughter who lives with him in Berlin. So that must mean that he was previously married.</p><p><strong>You Don't Want To Miss:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel=follow>Stephanie Birkitt Married Or Dating?
