In 1991, he began hosting his own talk show, which became very well-known for its segment on paternity tests.

They first crossed paths when she began working at WTTG in 1969. Despite their initial meeting, they didn’t immediately hit it off and have love at first sight. “In 1969, I was a copygirl at a little TV station in Washington, D.C. and he was a big star and I was just a kid,” Connie told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>&nbsp;in an October 2020 interview. “I would rip the wire copy off the machine and give it to Mr. Povich. He was very gruff and very matter-of-fact. He never looked up. I kept thinking, ‘Maybe someday he’ll acknowledge that I’m a human being.'”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Connie left the TV station after two years, becoming a Washington correspondent for the CBS Evening News.&nbsp;The two reconnected in 1977, and by that point, Connie was a well-established journalist. The two of them fell in love when Maury moved to Los Angeles. “Connie was the big anchor star at the CBS affiliate and I was her co-act before they cleaned house. Because Connie was the only person I actually knew in Los Angeles, I always said the way to get to Connie’s heart is first, she pities you, and then she can love you. She pitied the fact that I was fired,” he told&nbsp;People.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Luckily, Connie’s love was true, and the couple ended up getting married in 1984, 15 years after they first met at the Washington TV station. The pair have remained married ever since.</p><h2>Connie Is a Veteran TV Journalist</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>While Maury has become very popular for his talk show, Connie is perhaps even more famous. She’s been an anchor and reporter for many major news networks over the years. She’s reported for national news networks CBS, NBC, ABC, and MSNBC. Many of her career highlights were with CBS, and she’s also had her own shows&nbsp;Eye to Eye With Connie Chung&nbsp;and&nbsp;Connie Chung Tonight.&nbsp;During her career, she interviewed many high profile people, including&nbsp;<strong>Kathleen Gingrich&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Magic Johnson.</strong></p><h2>Maury & Connie Have One Son Together</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>Over a decade after getting married, Maury and Connie became parents together, when they adopted their son&nbsp;<strong>Matthew Jay&nbsp;</strong>in 1995. The talk show host also has two daughters from his previous marriage.</p><h2>What Have They Said About Each Other?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>In addition to being beloved TV personalities, Maury and Connie have shown that they’re totally head over heels for one another still almost 40 years into their marriage. In the above-mentioned&nbsp;People&nbsp;profile, Maury admitted that when the pair get into an argument, he lets it go after he wakes up the next morning, although Connie did admit to “hold[ing] grudges.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Despite that small difference, Maury did tell the magazine that he wouldn’t trade any moment with Connie for the world. “We’ve always respected each other’s careers and we’ve always respected each other’s space and values,” he told the outlet. “There’s no need for any do-overs. Maybe that’s the reason why we’re still married.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Connie had a similar comment. “I would go back and relive every moment,” she said.</p><h2>They Co-Hosted a Show Together</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>While Maury and Connie are both very successful on their own, they did briefly come together for a short-lived weekend news show on MSNBC. They had a six-month run with their program&nbsp;Weekends With Maury and Connie&nbsp;in 2006.</p><h2>Maury’s First Marriage</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Connie was not Maury’s first wife. Prior to reconnecting with her in 1977, the talk show host was wed to&nbsp;<strong>Phyllis Minkoff&nbsp;</strong>from 1962 to 1979.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yarKuxXaW8t7XCoWSwoZaaeqS7zaegnmWTncKvs4xuaWppYmd%2BcA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./chris-noth-and-wife-tara-wilsons-relationship-timeline.html>&#171;&nbsp;Chris Noth and Wife Tara Wilson's Relationship Timeline</a>
