YouTuber&nbsp;uploaded for Father's day back in 2016, he tried to put into words how he felt about it.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Despite not knowing his own dad, Jev was quick to wish all of his fans and followers a happy Father's Day fairly early on in the video.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why&nbsp;FaZe Jev Made The "Parents"&nbsp;Video</h2><p>After he got the greetings out of the way, he jumped right into why he thought he needed to make a video about his parents.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Jev addressed how the last time he made a Father's Day video, it was a standard commentary video talking about that day and how his father wasn't around as he grew up.</p><p>However, this time around, he wanted to explain things in a bit more detail.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The famed YouTuber also noted that he was not and did not make videos like this one to garner pity for himself. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Instead, he did it to let other people — people who'd been through the same things — know&nbsp;that they weren't alone.&nbsp;</p><h2>FaZe Jev's Dad Walked Out on Him</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Jev reached out with kind words and said he understood that not having a father figure or mother figure in one's life could have a significant impact on who they were as a person.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Still, Jev considered himself lucky that his grandparents took him in after his dad had just walked out of his life.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"Honestly, I don't even know the whole story," he admitted.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He just knew that his father wasn't around for much, and although they had talked a couple of times, they never really had a conversation.&nbsp;</p><h2>FaZe Jev Appreciates His Grandparents</h2><p>Jev also extended his appreciation for the "real" parents who took children in when these kids were without parents for a multitude of reasons.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>That was his segue into talking about his grandparents, who filled the parents-shaped void he had growing up.&nbsp;</p><p>"To be honest, I know it's Father's Day but without both of my grandparents I&nbsp;wouldn't be the person that I am today," Jev candidly shared, "I wouldn't have grown up as well as I did."</p><p>Thanks to his grandparents, Jev was kept from having a difficult childhood. He was grateful for the fact that he had a sheltered life and food in his stomach every single day.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He affirmed that his grandparents did a great job raising him, and any and all stupid things that he went on to do as an adult were his fault.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>For FaZe Jev, His Grandfather&nbsp;Was His Dad</h2><p>Jev also projected a scenario where he was raised by someone else, say, his biological father.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The YouTuber could not even imagine the kind of person he would have grown up to become.</p><p>I'm really happy with who I am right now, and&nbsp;I may have been a completely different person if I were raised under different circumstances.</p><p>He also acknowledged&nbsp;how his grandparents had done everything for him, even though they were not obliged to. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>And in so doing, to this day, Jev saw his grandfather as a father figure;&nbsp;the only father figure&nbsp;in his life.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Towards the end, he urged everyone watching his video to be thankful to have a parental figure in their lives because "you owe a part of your identity to these people."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJ6Rr7JutsSvZJ2ZlGO1tbnL</p></div><div id=links><a href=./celebs-wearing-leather-jackets-fashion-trend-3555862.html>&#171;&nbsp;Gigi Hadid &amp;amp; More Try The Trend Hollywood Life</a>
