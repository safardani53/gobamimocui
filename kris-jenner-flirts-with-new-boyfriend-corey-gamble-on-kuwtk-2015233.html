It's been 25 years since <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong></a> last dated, but the mom of six hasn't lost her touch — in the second episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians' tenth season, we learned that not only is Jenner skilled at flirting via text, but she's also happily dating a gorgeous man younger than two of her children (cougar alert!).</p><p><strong>The Stats</strong></p><p><strong>Name: </strong>Corey Gamble</p><p><strong>Age:</strong> 34</p><p><strong>Who He Is:</strong> Gamble works with <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a>'s manager, <strong>Scooter Braun</strong>.</p><p><strong>How They Met:</strong> Jenner and her new beau were introduced during an August 2014 trip to Ibiza, Spain, at <strong>Riccardo Tisci</strong>'s 40th birthday party. <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>, and Bieber were all in attendance.</p><p><strong>The Reaction</strong></p><p>The KUWTK episode began with <a href=#><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a> joking about taking Jenner's phone and seeing who she's been texting — and then they actually did it. Seeing your mom (or pseudo-mother-in-law) get her flirt on is probably not something you really want to do, but the pair did it anyway and discovered that Jenner does not need any help in the suggestive text department.</p><p>"I don't know if Kris googled how to be sexy over text, but she's doing it and it's inappropriate and very uncomfortable," Disick said.</p><p>Hey, bro, you brought that on yourself!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Weirdness</strong></p><p>Kim wasn't mad that her mother was seeing someone new, she just wanted her to be cautious. "My mom has been out of the dating game for decades so I want her to have fun again and to meet someone," she said, "but I just hope that she really thinks things through and doesn't just rush into anything."</p><p>&nbsp;But that doesn't mean it's not weird to see your mom date again after more than two decades of marriage. "I hope she's having fun and I want that for her, but it's just obviously weird if she's dating someone new," Kim told her sisters.</p><p><strong>The Confession</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong></a> grilled her mother about her new special friend, and Jenner tried to play it cool. It's "just hanging out right now," Jenner said.</p><p>But Khloe knew better, and saw the sly grin Jenner would sport every time she sent Gamble a message. "I know that look and that feeling. That leads me to believe you might be into him," she said.</p><p><strong>The Overshare</strong></p><p>Even worse than reading your mom's sexy texts? Hearing her have sex with her new man, which is what Kim had to endure living under her mother's bedroom. "The bed, like, bangs up against the wall," she revealed to her sisters. Hey, if she has to hear it, they have to hear about it. That way they can all be equally scarred.</p><p><strong>Can I Live?!</strong></p><p>Jenner finally told her daughters she'd had enough of their ribbing. "It's so annoying that my own family is being so judgmental because all I really want to do is live my life," she confessed.&nbsp;</p><p>The fifth degree was fun for a while, but Jenner's daughters realized they'd given their mom plenty of grief. "The truth is I think we're all really protective of her," Khloe said. "I think at the end of the day we want her to be happy, and if she is, then we're happy for her."</p><p>Kim put it more succinctly: "You do you, boo!"</p><p>But as one half of a couple for so long, Jenner had forgotten how to even do that. "I'm just getting my sea legs," she said. "I don't know how to do me. I'm figuring it out one day at a time."</p><p><strong>The Happiness</strong></p><p>As strange as it was for Jenner's daughters that she's dating again, at least the object of their mother's affection seems to be utterly infatuated with her. "I'm a lucky mother f—-r," he whispered in her ear as they danced at the end of the episode.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Elsewhere, in Kardashian Land…</strong></p><p>Kim and <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a> spent the episode arguing about whether Kim could use her older sister's likeness for her bestselling game, Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, until Jenner stepped in at the last minute to broker peace. Khloe and Disick grew closer as they hosted a Halloween party together, while Khloe learned a valuable lesson about thinking before posting possibly insensitive comments on instagram and Disick reflected on his partying ways and how he was able to have a great time at the club on Halloween without drinking.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKKroaNit6a6zZ6pZp6cnr%2B1v4ywoK2gXaOyuHnBqLCfqpmau6V5wqipnrFdnK6ursueZKimXaDCuMDKZmlpaWVngHR7</p></div><div id=links><a href=./zdg87vuph7njdyvximoub9i8jas116fn.html>&#171;&nbsp;Watch My Life As A Teenage Robot Season 3 Episode 5: Girl of Steal/Mist Opportunities</a>
