The 39-year-old country singer, who divorced her husband,&nbsp;<strong>Mike Caussin</strong>, in 2021, is now ready for the next chapter of her life with&nbsp;<strong>Allan Russell</strong>. The two have been together for less than a year, but have made some big life decisions in that time.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>At the end of May 2023, Jana confirmed that she and Allan had <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>gotten engaged</a>.&nbsp;“It was a really beautiful night, and me and the kids were all sitting… on the front porch of the steps, and just looking out at the view,” she gushed on the May 25, 2023 episode of her podcast, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Whine Down with Jana Kramer</a>. “And he said my name, and I got up or whatever and then he got down on one knee, and Jolie just started jumping up and down. It was the cutest thing ever, it’s like she knew what was happening.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Allan-Russell-Jana-Kramer-5-Things-SS-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Then, just two weeks later, on June 8, Jana confirmed to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> that she was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pregnant</a>. She explained that she and Allan had started discussing expanding their family at the beginning of 2023, and that she found out she was pregnant in March. “Beyond blessed and grateful for this baby to be part of our story,” Jana gushed on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>All of this&nbsp; exciting news came less than five months after Jana went <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> official <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>by sharing a photo</a> of her and Allan laughing together in Jan. 2023. “<span>Back where it all started…</span><span>Also this is so us…trying to take a photo,” she captioned the sweet snapshot. </span>Find out more about Alan and his romance with Jana below.</p><h2>Allan Is A Former Professional Soccer Player</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>Allan’s now a soccer coach after retiring as a player. He previously played for Hamilton Academical, St Mirren, Macclesfield Town, Mansfield Town, and Partick Thistle around the U.K., per <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>BBC</a>. He then headed to the U.S. to play for the North Carolina FC and Los Angeles Blues.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>The athlete, who was born in Glasgow, Scotland and raised in England, now works as a specialist attacking coach for Norwich City FC, according to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> bio. He also founded <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Superior Striker</a>, an elite attacking training program for soccer players. He was one of the trainers that helped England’s team train for the 2018 World Cup.</p><h2>When Did Allan And Jana Start Dating?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>It’s unclear exactly when these two started seeing each other, but fans first started guessing that there was a new romance in Jana’s life at the end of 2022. She began taking trips across the pond, and fans gathered that there was a man waiting for her on the other side. However, Jana didn’t publicly confirm the news until the Jan. 9 episode of her&nbsp;Whine Down&nbsp;podcast.</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>“Yes, it was a week later I flew out here [for this trip], but only because I can’t come back because, you know, weekends [with the kids] and, you know, there’s things that I couldn’t rearrange and right now with his job, he can’t come,” she said, confirming that her trip to England in Dec. 2022 was actually a getaway to visit Allan. “So I’ll have to do more of the bulk of the flying for the next few months. But I’m excited about it. And you know, in three weeks, hopefully, I’ll be back. … I’m happy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-12>Fans began begging Jana to reveal her mystery man’s identity, and on Jan. 26, she got a bit closer when she posted a photo of them FaceTiming each other. However, she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>covered Allan’s face</a> with a big emoji. It wasn’t until Jan. 31 that Jana actually showed off Allan’s face for the first time on her page.</p><h2>How Did Jana Kramer & Allan Russell Meet?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-13>Although Jana was previously against meeting someone online, she met Allan through a dating app! Jana was skeptical about forging a connection with Allan at first, since he lived in the UK and she lived in Nashville. However, she felt that there was “something about him” that made her want to keep the conversation going. From the beginning, the two were dedicated to trying to make sure they saw each other every three weeks.</p><p id=content-paragraph-14>“It just feels different,” she said on her podcast. “Who I am in this relationship is who I’ve always wanted to be.”</p><h2>Allan Has A Son</h2><p id=content-paragraph-17>Allan has a teenage son named <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Troy</strong> </a>from a previous relationship. He often refers to him as his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“little man”</a> and<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> “little mate”</a> on Instagram and has been<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> training him for years</a> to be the next soccer star. Jana has two kids from her previous marriage to <strong>Mike Caussin</strong>. They share a daughter <strong>Jolie</strong>, 7, and son <strong>Jace</strong>, 4.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>On another episode of&nbsp;Whine Down in Jan. 2023, Jana opened up about her fears of blending the families. At that point, her kids had not met Allan yet, but the two had already started talking about the future. “It makes me excited but it also makes me scared. You just never know, right?” she explained. “And with kids, I don’t want them to be in a place where their ground isn’t as steady as possible.”</p><h2>Allan Is A Proud Dog Dad</h2><p id=content-paragraph-21>One look at his Instagram page shows that Allan loves his pup, Alba. He even included her in a Valentine’s Day post for Jana, as seen above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KurbjAp2SrraOosq24jG5nanFiaYZw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./azaria-carter-uu3i-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Azaria Carter (TV Actress) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More</a>
