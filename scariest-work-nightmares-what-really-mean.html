we are also having unsettling dreams.</p><p>Lee, who is working with <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">MattressNextDay</a> said: "There is still uncertainty about what the future looks like, and returning to work can generate heightened states, from anxiety to excitement.&nbsp;</p><p>“This can make it harder to sleep, increasing the chance of dreaming when we finally drift off.</p><p>"The added stress can also make people more likely to have vivid dreams, and the change in our routines and restlessness mean we are more likely to wake and remember the vivid dream we have had.”</p><p>Here Lee reveals the top 10 work-related nightmares that are on the rise.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Wellbeing</h2></p><h2>1. Stress dreams</h2><p>In the last three months there has been a 43 per cent increase in people dreaming about work stress.</p><p>Lee said that having stress dreams about work “is likely to relate to a feeling of overwhelm about all the unknowns of returning to the office and memories of those days previously at work when you were bombarded with deadlines and tasks to complete.”</p><h2>2. Being naked in public</h2><p>Lee explained that this might relate to a feeling of being exposed - and if you're dreaming of this then you're not alone as there has been a 30 per cent increase in people having this dream in the last three months.</p><p>Lee said that you might be afraid of meeting new people and going back to a full office.</p><p>He added: "Or it may signify you feel unprepared and are even struggling with imposter syndrome".</p><h2>3. Brakes not working in a car</h2><p>This can be quite a frightening dream to have and Lee says this may be down to a feeling of loss of control that you have when it comes to going back to the office.</p><p>While some companies have been flexible with their approach, others have made all employees return without a phased reopening or flexible working.</p><p>In the last three months searches for this dream have gone up by 29 per cent and Lee says that this dream could also be down to a 'loss of domestic comforts'.</p><h2>4. Running away</h2><p>In the last three months, searches for dreaming of running away have increased by 24 per cent.</p><p>Lee explains: "Dreams about running away often convey a feeling of being chased, the pressure to perform at work which might be amplified at the office, and the ever-increasing workload, demands and distractions of being back in your workplace.<strong>”</strong></p><h2>5. Being late</h2><p>During Covid lockdowns there really weren't many excuses you could use for being late as gone were the days of blaming a delayed train.</p><p>As many of us get back to normality, people dreaming of being late has also gone up by 21 per cent.</p><p>Lee said that it's understandable that many of us are out of the rhythm of commuting.</p><p>He added: "Dreams about being late link back to a feeling of being unprepared or feeling like you're not going to meet the expectations of you when you return to the workplace, falling short of the company's expectations."</p><h2>6. Pregnancy</h2><p>Dreaming of pregnancy can be overwhelming, but Lee says these dreams actually often relate to a new chapter and growth.</p><p>With a 19 per cent increase in searches in the last three months, it seems that many people are looking for new avenues.</p><p>Lee added: "So maybe you are looking forward to returning to the office. Or are seriously thinking about taking a new position or career decision.”</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">How to stop dreaming about work</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>If you're sick of waking up in a panic, then try these tips to help you get a more restful nights sleep.</p><li><strong>Ask questions: </strong>If you are feeling overwhelmed about the unknowns of returning to the office, speak to someone in HR and ask questions about what the office will be like when you arrive, who will be in and whether anything in the office has changed in terms of layout.</li><li><strong>Do a test run:</strong> Dreams about being late for work came fifth place so if you are feeling anxious about being late for work, try timing how long it takes for you to get ready in the morning, plan your journey into the office and give yourself extra time in case of road closures or your bus being late.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Prepare:</strong> If you are feeling underprepared, write a to-do list. Whether it's the things you need to bring into the office or a list of jobs to do that day, writing a to-do list can help ease your anxiety.</li><li><strong>Reduce caffeine:</strong> With life returning to normal you may be feeling tired as you try to get back into your old routine but caffeine could be the reason why you’re feeling more anxious than you normally would.</li><li><strong>Get a routine:</strong> Much like creating a routine before you go to work, having a routine before you go to bed can also help ease your anxiety. Consistency is key when it comes to creating a routine, something as simple as having a warm shower before bed or writing a to-do list for the next day can help clear your mind.</li><li><strong>Switch off:</strong> Always take the time to spend some time away from your computer screen during your working day. Consider taking a walk on your lunch, avoid eating at your desk and try to go outside for some fresh air.</li><h2>7. Being chased</h2><p>In the last three months there has been a 19 per cent increase in the number of people searching for dreams of being chased.</p><p>Lee said: "Once again, the feeling of being chased confers increased expectations upon us that we feel might be a threat to our wellbeing, hence we start to consider this intensity as something that is following us at speed."</p><h2>8. A swimming pool</h2><p>Lee said that decoding dreams about a swimming pool is never an easy task.</p><p>In the last three months searches for dreaming of swimming pools has gone up by 16 per cent.</p><p>Lee said understanding this dream comes down to how you react to the pool in your dream.</p><p>He explained: "If you can't wait to jump in, it's likely to suggest you are ready to return to the office.</p><p>"But if it comes with a feeling of dread, you might be worried about returning to the workplace being similar to being thrown in at the deep end."</p><h2>9. Clowns</h2><p>This dream might be quite disturbing for some people and in the last three months searches for dreaming of clowns has gone up 15 per cent.</p><p>Again Lee said it depends on how you react to the clown.</p><p>"If you reacted to the clown with fear, it might suggest you are worried about the return and the seriousness of being back in the official premises.</p><p>"On the other hand, if you’re being entertained, that is probably a sign you are ready for some office humour yourself after the seriousness of the past 18 months", Lee said.</p><h2>10. Losing your job</h2><p>There's no surprise that people have been dreaming of losing their job, and searches for this have gone up 12 per cent in the last three months.</p><p>During the Covid pandemic many sectors were hit hard and resulted in redundancies and job losses.</p><p>Lee said: "This is a sign of exhaustion and fatigue, which many have suffered from over the pandemic.</p><p>"It could mean you are not sure about your future career, or that things feel very unstable and insecure at the moment.</p><p>"But it might also represent the freedom of getting back out there and expressing yourself."</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Nearly half of Americans dream about what they’re going to eat the next day</span><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIB4g5FxbG5no5ius7XErKtmr5%2BnuG66yKCfraWRp7K0edahmK1lopqurbjYZqSemZ5k</p></div><div id=links><a href=./welsh-grand-national-runner-guide-templegate-tip.html>&#171;&nbsp;Welsh Grand National runner-by-runner guide and Templegate tip for Chepstow cracker</a>
