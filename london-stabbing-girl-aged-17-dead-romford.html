an hour later.</p><p>The girl's next of&nbsp; kin have been informed but officers say they are awaiting formal identification.</p><p>A post-mortem examination will be held in due course, detectives say.</p><p>Neighbours claim that two men stabbed the girl before running off - and even left the blade in her back.</p><p>Teresa Farenden, 49, whose house faces onto the park, described hearing screams for help before racing to give first aid.</p><p>The mum-of-three said:&nbsp;"The knife blade was still in her, but I didn't see it because it was dark.</p><p>"I didn't realise at the time, but then all I kept thinking once the police told me was 'have I put the knife in further by giving her compressions?'"</p><p>I never thought in a million years that I was coming out to a murder</p><span class=quote-credit>Teresa Farenden</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>neighbour</span><p>She added: "It was horrific, it was just the blood. There must've been two pints of blood. There was so much of it.</p><p>"The girl was moaning, but she was mostly silent. We checked her pulse and we could hear her breathing."</p><p>Teresa says she was in the kitchen when she heard her son call: "Mum, somebody is shouting 'help' from the park."</p><p>She said:&nbsp;"I never thought in a million years that I was coming out to a murder and that I would be walking out to a young lady who had been stabbed.</p><p>"I was trying to do my coat up in the drive and I shouted out 'is everything okay?' as I was worried it could be kids drinking.</p><p>"Then a boy said 'no I need help, my girlfriend has been stabbed' and I just flew over there in my flip flops."<br></p><h2>DESPERATE BATTLE</h2><p>Teresa found the victim laying on her back in the corner of the park beside her boyfriend before putting her in the recovery position and administering CPR.</p><p>Teresa said: "People are scared to help, but all I was thinking with my mother's instinct was 'I need to help'.</p><p>"Her boyfriend did everything he could. When I came over she was on her back so I moved her onto her side.</p><p>"Then the boyfriend's friend came over with some kitchen roll.</p><p>"Then there was another girl and a man came over in a van to help and took his coat off to keep it on the wound and keep it compressed as much as they could.</p><p>"Just as the ambulance crew turned up, she had gone. It was devastating."</p><p>People are scared to help, but all I was thinking with my mother's instinct was 'I need to help'</p><span class=quote-credit>eyewitness</span><p>The brave resident said it is the first time in the 16 years she has lived by the park that "anything like this has happened" and said she "hopes it is also the last."</p><p>Scotland Yard said there have been no arrests and detectives continue to investigate.</p><p>Acting Detective Chief Superintendent John Ross said: “Yesterday a 17-year-old girl lost her life, and I want to express my deepest sympathies to this girl’s family and friends.</p><p>"Her death is a tragedy. I can reassure them and the whole community that we are doing everything possible to identify and bring to justice the person or persons responsible.</p><p>“It is days like these that really do highlight how we must continue to work tirelessly with our partners and the public to tackle knife crime."</p><p>Her death is the 18th brutal murder of the year so far as the capital is gripped by a knife crime epidemic.</p><p>Earlier this week a 20-year-old man was stabbed to death outside Ilford train station.</p><p>London mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted: "Devastated by the fatal stabbing of a 17 year-old girl in Havering.</p><p>"My thoughts are with her loved ones.</p><p>"It fills me with anger that violent criminals are targeting young Londoners with their whole lives before them.</p><p>"I encourage anyone with information to contact the police."<br></p><h2>RESIDENTS IN SHOCK</h2><p>A small group of people cried and hugged each other after laying a bunch of flowers at the cordon with the message "we love you forever in our hearts."<br>Another message attached to a floral tribute said: "You are so strong. We will always remember you."</p><p>The park, which has been the focus of forensics officers, is known locally as Amy's Park, with a playground in the centre.</p><p>Councillor Paul McGeary spoke of his "shock and horror" that the killing had happened in the semi-rural outer London borough.</p><p>He said: "This is not something that happens here and I am just completely surprised."</p><p>Cllr McGeary could not say if it was gang-related, but described it as "tragic".<br>He added: "It is very shocking for the whole community. I think people will be talking to each other and hopefully providing support to the relatives if the unfortunate person who died."</p><p>You are so strong. We will always remember you.</p><span class=quote-credit>tributes</span><p>Fellow councillor Tele Lawal, 22, said: "It is not an area where you will frequently see violence like this.</p><p>"It is going to shock our community but it just shows the strain that is happening with young people, with our police and the resources we need in our community to tackle violence like this."</p><p>She said she used to play in the park, which is now cordoned off with police tape and guarded by officers.</p><p>She said: "It is just a normal place. It is not a place where you would think something like this would happen.</p><p>"It is just so sad the things that are happening in our community. We need to come together and definitely find a solution to tackling crime like this because a 17-year-old girl should not have passed away."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>A resident, who lives opposite the park and did not know the victim, described the death as "a terrible thing".</p><p>The man, who did not want to give his name, said: "She was just 17 and just starting her life. How could anyone do that to a woman? It is disgusting. It is happening a lot in London lately. It is becoming a normal thing and that is terrifying."</p><p>Anyone with information is asked to call 020 8345 3775, tweet @MetCC or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473098906.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473098908.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473103837.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473085954.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473107306.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473091730.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473091732.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sadiq.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473085955.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000473085957.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfbYJ1gJdxbWikn6OxsLqMrKuampKeu6h5xqKppWWRnLKleZBwZJ2dkZl6s7vMn6arnF8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jenna-bush-hager-shares-son-hals-reaction-after-she-said-he-was-cut-out-of-my-tummy-on-4th-birthday-7568989.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jenna Bush Hager Recalls Son Hal's Birth Story on His 4th Birthday</a>
