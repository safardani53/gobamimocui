I'd like to have a girlfriend and a family. But I haven't met the right one yet. Until then I'm focusing on my job. I had to wait so long for this chance I savor every second on set even if it means 14 hours of shooting a day."&nbsp;</p><p>In real, Miller was not out of the closet. Maybe that's the reason he said so.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/Luke%20Mcfarlane%20Wentworth%20Miller.jpg alt="Luke Mcfarlane and Wentworth Miller in Los Angeles in 2007." ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In 2013, <a href=# rel=noopener>Wentworth confirmed that he is gay in a letter posted on the GLAAD website</a>, declining the invitation to a Russian Film festival. Well, he refused the invitation because the Russian do not treat gay men and women properly, In the letter he wrote;</p><p>Thank you for your kind invitation. As someone who has enjoyed visiting Russia in the past and can also claim a degree of Russian ancestry, it would make me happy to say yes</p><p>He wrote to the director of the St. Petersburg Film Festival, Maria Averbakh.</p><p>However, as a gay man, I must decline</p><p>He added;</p><p>I am deeply troubled by the current attitude toward and treatment of gay men and women by the Russian government. The situation is in no way acceptable, and I cannot in good conscience participate in a celebratory occasion hosted by a country where people like myself are being systematically denied their basic right to live and love openly. If circumstances improve, I'll be free to make a different choice.</p><p>Well, it's too brave of him to come out as gay; like it is said, it's better than never.</p><p>There were many speculations of him being gay but as long as the person doesn't reveal it by himself, all people can do was to keep guessing.</p><h2>Luke Macfarlane on coming out as gay</h2><p>Luke mentioned that his career took a sudden fall after he confessed to being gay.</p><p>When the media asked him how is he feeling and dealing with the kind of responses he received afterward, he replied;</p><p>"I feel strongly that there is a distinction between revealing my sexual preference and my most private thoughts. My sexual preference is one irrefutable aspect of me, like the color of my skin. I’ve never been interested in revealing intimate details about my life. The concern with engaging with the media has to do with trying to make sure they will understand this difference".&nbsp;</p><p>Pretty ironic! The play he was playing as Scotty was his, in fact, his true identity. The series came out as a blessing to his life that it influenced and encouraged him to reveal his sexuality to the world.</p><p>Currently, Luke is single and is not dating anyone at the moment. We don't know, he may be secretly dating someone and not telling us about it.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRjC7knf1MbblyQuh0STV5s1UmzBADSJR90n6JwCJ6zp3XLujTucA" alt="Luke Macfarlance's series Brothers and Sisters influenced him to come out as gay" ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Girls drool over the hot guys of the Hollywood and although gay men are off the market for girls, it doesn't stop them. Right? There are tons (and I mean TONS) of gay celebrities who have been the subject of female fantasies for ages, from the golden boys of old-time Hollywood like <strong>Rock Hudson</strong> to the newest major-league hotties like <a href=# rel=noopener>Colton Haynes</a>.
