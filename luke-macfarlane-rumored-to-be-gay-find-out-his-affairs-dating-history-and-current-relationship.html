I'd like to have a girlfriend and a family. But I haven't met the right one yet. Until then I'm focusing on my job. I had to wait so long for this chance I savor every second on set even if it means 14 hours of shooting a day."&nbsp;</p><p>In real, Miller was not out of the closet. Maybe that's the reason he said so.</p><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/liverampup.com/uploads/images/Luke%20Mcfarlane%20Wentworth%20Miller.jpg alt="Luke Mcfarlane and Wentworth Miller in Los Angeles in 2007." ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In 2013, <a href=# rel=noopener>Wentworth confirmed that he is gay in a letter posted on the GLAAD website</a>, declining the invitation to a Russian Film festival. Well, he refused the invitation because the Russian do not treat gay men and women properly, In the letter he wrote;</p><p>Thank you for your kind invitation. As someone who has enjoyed visiting Russia in the past and can also claim a degree of Russian ancestry, it would make me happy to say yes</p><p>He wrote to the director of the St. Petersburg Film Festival, Maria Averbakh.</p><p>However, as a gay man, I must decline</p><p>He added;</p><p>I am deeply troubled by the current attitude toward and treatment of gay men and women by the Russian government. The situation is in no way acceptable, and I cannot in good conscience participate in a celebratory occasion hosted by a country where people like myself are being systematically denied their basic right to live and love openly. If circumstances improve, I'll be free to make a different choice.</p><p>Well, it's too brave of him to come out as gay; like it is said, it's better than never.</p><p>There were many speculations of him being gay but as long as the person doesn't reveal it by himself, all people can do was to keep guessing.</p><h2>Luke Macfarlane on coming out as gay</h2><p>Luke mentioned that his career took a sudden fall after he confessed to being gay.</p><p>When the media asked him how is he feeling and dealing with the kind of responses he received afterward, he replied;</p><p>"I feel strongly that there is a distinction between revealing my sexual preference and my most private thoughts. My sexual preference is one irrefutable aspect of me, like the color of my skin. Iâve never been interested in revealing intimate details about my life. The concern with engaging with the media has to do with trying to make sure they will understand this difference".&nbsp;</p><p>Pretty ironic! The play he was playing as Scotty was his, in fact, his true identity. The series came out as a blessing to his life that it influenced and encouraged him to reveal his sexuality to the world.</p><p>Currently, Luke is single and is not dating anyone at the moment. We don't know, he may be secretly dating someone and not telling us about it.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRjC7knf1MbblyQuh0STV5s1UmzBADSJR90n6JwCJ6zp3XLujTucA" alt="Luke Macfarlance's series Brothers and Sisters influenced him to come out as gay" ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Girls drool over the hot guys of the Hollywood and although gay men are off the market for girls, it doesn't stop them. Right? There are tons (and I mean TONS) of gay celebrities who have been the subject of female fantasies for ages, from the golden boys of old-time Hollywood like <strong>Rock Hudson</strong> to the newest major-league hotties like <a href=# rel=noopener>Colton Haynes</a>.
