He was not injured during the incident.&nbsp;</p><p>Their teenage daughter, Bailey Kruse, was also home when the tragedy took place, and though she heard the shot, she was unharmed as well.&nbsp;</p><p>While calling the police, Jan Kruse's husband indicated that the back door of the home was open. He also stated that someone had come into the bedroom to shoot Jan Kruse, but that he didn't see who that person was.</p><p>When the authorities arrived, they noted that there were broken windows at the home. This would support the theory that someone could have broken in.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Nothing was taken, however, leading investigators to believe that Jan Kruse was targeted, and that the killing wasn't likely a robbery-gone-wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>Prior to the murder, the Kruse family's garage had mysteriously burned down too.</p><p>Eventually, the focus shifted to Chris Kruse, as no other seemingly viable suspects emerged. Some of his interview material at the police station was inconsistent, and there was focus placed on the nature of the 911 call.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Plus, they found a shotgun (the type of weapon used in the crime) at Chris Kruse's carpentry shop, and the K-9 unit could not trace a smell of an intruder.</p><p>As for a motive, the investigators had a theory.&nbsp;</p><p>They learned that Chris Kruse and Jan Kruse had a desire to buy the Spider Lake Resort, a place where they had vacationed before. But they could not afford it, even with the loan that the bank was willing to give them.</p><p>Investigators determined that Chris Kruse's motive was his wife's life insurance policy which, when cashed, would cover the amount needed to purchase the resort.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, Chris Kruse was arrested on charges of first- and second-degree murder. But the case was far from over.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is Chris Kruse now?</h2><p>After his initial arrest in March of 2019, Chris Kruse went on trial in early 2020. He was represented by Steven Groschen and Thomas Hagen from the Kohlmeyer Hagen Law Office in Mankato, Minn.&nbsp;</p><p>Following a two-week trial, the jurors deliberated for approximately 12 hours before acquitting Chris Kruse of the charges.</p><p>The defense argued that Chris Kruse was in shock while making the 911 call, which explained his demeanor and his inability to perform potentially life-saving procedures like CPR.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>They also stated that it could not be confirmed that the shots came from Chris Kruse's gun, or that he had enough time to stash it in his carpentry office before calling the police.&nbsp;</p><p>During the trial, Chris Kruse's legal team also offered up another suspect: Bailey Kruse's boyfriend. They argued that he owned the same type of shotgun as the one used in the killing.</p><p>There have been no other arrests made in the murder of Jan Kruse.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris Kruse is now 46 years old, and he contributed to the Dateline episode about his late wife.&nbsp;</p><p>The Dateline episode featuring the murder of Jan Kruse airs on Dec. 4 at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSjmZ5iuLPB0p4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-tom-kaulitz-heidi-klum-husband.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who Is Heidi Klum's Husband?
