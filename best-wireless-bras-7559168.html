While wired bras provide a rounded and lifted shape — which Tempesta says was considered "aesthetically pleasing" in the ‘80s and ‘90s — a more natural shape is now more preferred, not just for looks but also for comfort, since wired bras can feel a bit restricting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Besides the comfort factor, wireless bras tend to look more natural and seamless underneath your clothing,” says Jodi Caden, the co-founder of the women’s undergarment brand Proof. “They’re great for transitioning from work to workout and beyond.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested 16 popular options on the market to determine which wireless bras are the best.

We tested this bra on several bust sizes and were impressed with the overall range of support it offers small and DD busts alike. The wireless bra also boasts excellent coverage (which could factor into the support) and we love that it has a super soft band that is strong enough to hold us in place without digging or feeling too restrictive.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While we like the pops of color, we wish this bra was available in more nude colors to complement a wider range of skin tones.

However, the undergarments brand also makes an incredible wireless bra with great coverage. We tested the Knix WingWoman Contour Bra and, after several wears, found it offers more support than our wired bra styles, especially since it provides busts with a little lift. Although the style is a little plunging in the front, the bra actually boasts excellent coverage on the cups and especially on the sides, which have a thicker than usual band design.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the bra sizing is a little different compared to traditional bras (definitely use the size chart when shopping!), we found that the overall fit was amazing and love how the bra has five panels of hook and eye clasps on the band, allowing for more customization and adjustments with wear over time.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Material: </strong>Nylon, spandex, polyester<strong> </strong>|<strong> Cup Range: </strong>A-G | <strong>Band Range: </strong>28-42 | <strong>Colors: </strong>Black, bouquet blue, rose water, pistachio, violet magnolia, vapor, cobalt, and more | <strong>Adjustable Straps: </strong>Yes | <strong>Care: </strong>Machine wash cold, lay flat to dry</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--people commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-others-we-tried></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Others We Tried</span></h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><li><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Hanes SmoothTec Wireless Bra with Scoopback</a>: This bra didn’t impress us enough to make our best list, but it's worth noting as an option for wearing with pajamas or loungewear. The bra is unlined so there’s not much to it in terms of shaping and support (no adjustable straps, either); however, it provides a nice, comfortable layer for lounging. Additionally, it features a hook and eye closure band for a more customized fit — which you don’t typically see from this bralette style — and it costs less than $15, making it a solid budget-friendly option.</li><li><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Maidenform Pure Comfort Soft Support Lace Bralette</a>: The $18 Maidenform Pure Comfort Soft Support Lace Bralette didn’t quite knock it out of the park in the way the others did but still deserves a mention. It features a beautiful lace design with adjustable and convertible straps that allow you to customize the fit and style. It’s also made from recycled nylon with plenty of comfortable spandex stretch.&nbsp;Although we loved this bra and found it was comfortable for everyday wear, we thought the sizing could be a little more inclusive (it’s only available in S to XXL). We also had a hard time finding the best fit, so we recommend trying a couple of different sizes to find the best one for your busts.</li><li><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="nofollow nocaes">Truekind Everyday Comfort Straps Wireless Shaping Bra</a>: The Truekind Everyday Comfort Straps Wireless Shaping Bra also gets an honorable mention because it is one of the most comfortable bras we tried, thanks to its sports bra-like design and stretchy, breathable material. We also love that the bra has an adjustable band and straps and you can actually wear it two different ways, including racerback. However, it missed the mark on fit, particularly after wearing it a few times. Over the course of the testing period, we found that this bra stretched out and no longer had the same shaping benefits as it did when we first tried it on. With that in mind, we think it’s worth sizing down (especially since you can always modify the band and straps temporarily).<br></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-things-to-consider-when-buying-wireless-bras></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Things to Consider When Buying Wireless Bras</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Sizing and Fit</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">According to Jené Luciani Sena, bra expert and the bestselling author of The Bra Book, wireless bras are often alpha-sized, meaning they come in small, medium, large, and so-on. “That makes it a bit tougher to get the perfect fit,” she notes. When shopping for bras online — regardless of the type of sizing — it helps to look at the brand or product’s sizing chart to get a better idea of the measurements, cup range, and band range. Additionally, if you know that straps are usually a fit challenge, selecting a wireless bra with adjustable straps can make the world of difference.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Wireless bras also come in a variety of styles, which includes pullover options as well as one with clasps in the back (much like a traditional bra design). They also come lined or unlined, so it’s important to consider your preference when narrowing down your selections. “Unlined will often have seams on the cup, which may show through clothes but help support the cup and keep it from collapsing in lieu of an underwire,” Luciani Sena explains.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Stretch</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In the world of wireless bras, stretch is a double-edged sword. “The more a bra stretches, the less supportive it will be,” says Tempesta. “But the more it stretches, the more comfortable it will be." With that in mind, you’ll want to consider the overall stretch and your support requirements when shopping for a wireless bra.&nbsp;If you're looking for something that functions more as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>a piece of shapewear</a>, then too much stretch can compromise its smoothing and shaping capabilities.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-we-tested></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How We Tested</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To find the best wireless bras on the market, the PEOPLE Tested team researched dozens of options before narrowing it down to 16 styles.

That being said, she recommends having an array of different bras on hand for several uses.

Depending on how often someone works out, she says at least one medium support and one high support sports bra can come in handy — though, if you work out often, she recommends buying more as you’ll need to wash them after every use. In addition to these bra types, Tempesta says having one <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>good strapless bra</a> is ideal for special occasion outfits where bra straps may be an issue.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.92883211678832><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the best bra for heavy breasts?</span></p><p>The best wireless bra for large busts is the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Soma Full Coverage Wireless Unlined Bra</a>.
