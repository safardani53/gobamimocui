believe him when he says the devoted springer spaniel saved his life.</p><p>Once a high-powered manager with a multi-million-pound budget, he had hit rock bottom after a 2006 road accident left him with crippling spinal injuries that ended his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

painkillers, he could see no future.</p><p>It looked like the end of his social life and his hobby of cycling up to 600 miles a month around his home in Keswick, in the Lake District, where he lived with his wife Angela.</p><p>Kerry, 55, recalled: “I was isolated, dependent on heavy drugs and I felt a burden on my wife.</p><p>“The nerve damage meant I could only shuffle along. I started thinking I didn’t want to be here. Every day and night I would think about ending it all.</p><p>I knew exactly how I’d do it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000560943042-e1583360893555.jpg><p>Then, in August 2009, Angela persuaded him to go to the corner shop for some milk, simply to get him out of the house.</p><p>Kerry said: “I didn’t think I could do it but she made me go. I got to the corner of our road and saw Max’s nose sticking through the railing of a gate.</p><p>“I stopped to say hello because I’d had spaniels when I was younger. He looked at me and straight away there was a connection.</p><p>“Stuck in a yard, it was as if he was saying, ‘My life’s pretty rubbish and yours doesn’t look much better’.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000560943010-e1583361013968.jpg><p>“For me, it was a tiny glimmer of what life could become again.”</p><p>After that, Kerry would offer to pop out every day, just so he could see Max. Then, after a couple of weeks, he asked the dog’s owner if he could take him for a walk.</p><p>He said: “It was the best thing that has happened to me, after getting married.”</p><p>Kerry, who has now written a book, Max The Miracle Dog, said: “We went 60 feet up the road to a sandstone wall and I was exhausted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000560943019-e1583361586320.jpg><p>“When you have an ailment that people can’t see, but you’re shuffling away and physically gasping, you feel so self-conscious.</p><p>“But with Max, it didn’t matter. We could stop and it was just a man having a rest with his dog.”</p><p>From then on, Max provided Kerry with the motivation to go further and further. One of his first goals was to get to Derwentwater lake.</p><p>He said: “It’s six minutes’ walk from my house but it took us an hour and a half because I’d shuffle then stop, shuffle then stop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000560942457-e1583361517499.jpg><p>“I couldn’t have done it on my own because I would have panicked about how I would get back. But I wanted Max to get there because I remembered how much my old spaniels loved water.”</p><p>Still in immense pain, Kerry had found a reason to live — as well as a good listener.</p><p>He said: “I could tell him how bad I felt my life was. As anyone who has had a dog knows, they are very good listeners and it’s often easier to talk to them than to people.”</p><p>The arrangement also suited Max’s owner, who was a carer for her father and couldn’t exercise the dog as much as she would have liked. Kerry — who has since got two more dogs, Paddy, three, and Harry, one — said: “It was about reprogramming my brain. Being with Max took me from thinking,</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000560943046-e1583361647533.jpg><p>‘I’m in pain, I can’t do anything’ to ‘I can get out and do things again’.”</p><p>Such was his transformation, Kerry has since retrained as a locksmith.</p><p>He said: “I liked working out puzzles and thought it would let me work to my own schedule, allowing myself time off to recover when I needed it. The second thought was I could get a van and Max could come with me.”</p><p>To publicise his new business, Kerry made Max “Head of Security” and posted picturesque photos of him in the Lake District.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000560942653-e1583361874643.jpg><p>Life was becoming good again — but there was just one cloud. Kerry said: “Every day it broke my heart to give Max back. People would say, ‘Why don’t</p><p>you just get your own dog?’ And I’d say, ‘But then it wouldn’t be Max’. There is only one Max. He was my lifesaver.”</p><p>In 2012 fate stepped in again. Max’s owner was moving away and asked Kerry if he would like to adopt him.</p><p>Not long afterwards, despite the fact that he had only just mastered walking uphill, the pair climbed all 4,400ft of Ben Nevis, in the Scottish Highlands.</p><p>It took six hours to go up and down the UK’s highest peak — and it took Kerry three months to recover from the exertion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000567986447.jpg><p>He said: “It damn near killed us. I was a fool really but I thought, ‘Go for the biggest, why not?’ If I’d been alone, I might have been tempted to pretend I’d got to the top, but I couldn’t let Max down.</p><p>“It was the best feeling to get to the top. I was the highest person in the UK, with Max at my side.”</p><p>Kerry now manages his pain with nothing stronger than the odd paracetamol.</p><p>He said: “I was on prescription pills for ten years after the accident.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000567979682.jpg><p>“I would get anxious about when I would be able to take another one. By the end I was on the strongest medication the doctors could give.</p><p>“Sometimes I would take 12 a day and it didn’t touch the pain at all. The doctor said it would take two years to come off them, by reducing the strength gradually every month.</p><p>“I thought I knew better and stopped taking them. Four hours later, Angela begged me to take one because I was sat in a corner, shaking and sweating.</p><p>“I can understand how people do stupid things on drugs, like burglaries, because it’s the need for the next dose. I was addicted.”</p><p>Kerry took his last pill 18 months after he vowed to come off them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000560943016-e1583362142876.jpg><p>He said: “I struggle when it’s cold, wet and damp. If I go walking with my camera bag slung on my shoulder then I’ll feel it the next day.</p><p>“But I wouldn’t change anything. I’ve had a second chance at life. I was in a career that was cut-throat and ruthless.</p><p>“Going through what I have, I realise it’s not about money or a fancy car, it’s about time and health.</p><p>“You don’t need that much to get by and from helping others by talking to them and sharing Max with them, I’ve become a lot richer.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000560943050-e1583362352247.jpg><p>He and Max’s story has delighted people all over the world. Max’s Facebook page, Max Out In The Lake District, features pictures of all three of</p><p>Kerry’s dogs. It has more than 100,000 followers and led to an award from Keswick Tourism.</p><p>Last year, on the ITV programme Britain’s Top 100 Dogs, Kerry revealed what he had been through and how Max had helped him.</p><p>Now a mental health campaigner, he said: “Suddenly people were coming up to me and shaking my hand. Or they’d stop their car and tell me, ‘I’m glad you’re still here’.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000567419030.jpg><p>“Within 24 hours of the programme being aired I had 10,000 messages. So many people told me they had experienced something similar to me, or that they’d lost a loved one, and my dogs brought them some joy. I realised this could be a vessel for something bigger.”</p><p>Kerry has organised several charity walks with his dogs and has raised more than £130,000 for good causes.</p><p>Max and Paddy have received a commendation from the animal charity PDSA for bringing comfort and support to thousands of people.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN UK NEWS</h2></p><p>Max has trained as a therapy dog, and even attended a garden party for community champions at Buckingham Palace last year and received a pat from the Duchess of Cambridge — who he has also met in Keswick.</p><p>Kerry said: “There’s something special about Max, everyone who meets him says so. It’s something in the way he looks at you.</p><p>“He’s the most loyal, loving friend. He looked into my soul and fixed me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NINTCHDBPICT000560943023-e1583360545860.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Dog lost at beach found swimming half a MILE offshore two days later</span><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn5yfI9wbnFnk5a%2Fbq%2FRmqqhZZ2ev6Kvy55knaeXYrqixI4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./daya-gamage.html>&#171;&nbsp;Fame | Daya Gamage net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024</a>
