rel=nofollow>American Glutton</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the premiere episode of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>podcast</a>, which was released earlier this week, the 43-year-old Remember the Titans star discussed his relationship with food and how it’s changed over the years, starting with unhealthy binge-eating habits he started at the young age of 5.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I learned really quickly that if I wanted a second helping of lasagna, when I cleared my plate, I had to eat it in the kitchen without them seeing, that I was not supposed to have that second helping of lasagna,” Suplee said on the podcast, recalling a trip to his grandparents’ house in Vermont in which they expressed concern over his weight.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was also made to walk every day, which was ‘exercise,’ which I hated. I did not like being put on this forced march every morning” he continued.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I just started practicing sneaking food,” he said, adding that the behavior continued into his preteen and teenage years. By age 10, Suplee said he weighed more than 200 pounds, and his parents put him on a diet, starting years of on-and-off dieting.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Ethan Suplee.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ethan Suplee/Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I had this idea now that food was something that people didn’t want me to have, so if I wanted to have more, I needed to do it privately, and it became something that I was withholding from people,” he said, recalling nights out with friends that ended in drive-thru runs where he would eat three meals at once.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I became enormous,” he said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I definitely had a lot of trouble, you know, like, flying Southwest was a nightmare because they didn’t have first class. I had to get seatbelt extensions. I remember once I got a seatbelt extension and even with the seatbelt extension, I couldn’t get it closed. I’d always buy two seats.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Suplee said that he used food, alcohol and drugs to “numb” himself throughout his teenage years. “Health wasn’t something I ever thought about.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While his parents and grandparents expressed concern over his weight, Suplee doesn’t remember being teased by his peers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“If a kid my own age made fun of me, I would just fight them,” he said. “I wasn’t fighting every day because kids were calling me fat. So that wasn’t really an issue.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Suplee said that he got sober in 2002 and since then has tried just about any diet out there.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Ethan Suplee in Remember the Titans.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Disney</span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Ethan Suplee in&nbsp;My Name Is Earl.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Michael Yarish/NBC</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I lost a s—load of weight. I went from 530 to, at my lowest, 220,” Suplee said, adding that he developed a passion for cycling after My Name Is Earl, on which he played Randy Hickey, was canceled in 2009. “At 220, I was very, very thin.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But when he returned to acting a few years later, hundreds of pounds lighter, he said that it was more difficult for him to find work.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“At some point I was like, ‘Well f—, I’m just gonna get fat again because maybe it’ll be better for work,'” he said. “And honestly, it was.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>RELATED VIDEO: ‘Half Their Size’: Inspiring Women Talk About the Hardest Obstacles They Faced During Weight Loss</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In recent years, Suplee has appeared in TV shows like Raising Hope, Jennifer Falls, Chance, Santa Clarita Diet, The Ranch and the movie Motherless Brooklyn.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2017, Suplee opened up to Entertainment Weekly about how he almost didn’t land his role as D on Hulu’s Chance because of his weight loss.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Initially, the casting directors didn’t want me to come in because I’d lost a bunch of weight,” he said on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>EW‘s What to Watch podcast</a> at the time. “Apparently they had proposed me a bunch of times, but the casting directors were like, ‘No, he’s too thin now.'”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I’d gained a bunch of weight back because I actually didn’t find being thin all that it’s cracked up to be,” he added. “So we convinced them that I was heavier again, and I went in, and that was that. I was heavy enough.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On his American Glutton podcast, Suplee said that throughout his life, he’s “gained and lost probably close to 1,000 pounds at this point.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, the actor is focusing on using “food as an energy source” to achieve his goals in the gym.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“My goal right now is a six-pack, and I’m not far off. Pretty f— close actually.,” he said. “So it’s an utterly vain goal. I don’t care. Who cares? I’ve never had a vain goal like that before.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He added that he also wants to be able to deadlift twice his weight. “I’m basically there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iarq3Ax2icraCRo3q0wc%2BlnJ5lnZbAtLXVnmSwnZmctbV5y6iqrGc%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./winners-of-tough-as-nails-now.html>&#171;&nbsp;Where Are All the Winners From 'Tough as Nails' Now?</a>
