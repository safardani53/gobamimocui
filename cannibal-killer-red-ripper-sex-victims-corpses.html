I tried to hang myself. My mother and some young neighbours pulled me out of the noose.</p><p>"Well, I thought no one would want such a shamed man. So I had to run away from there, away from my homeland."</p><p>Despite the couple struggling with intimacy, wife Feodosia gave birth to a baby daughter and four years later a son, who would follow in his father's footsteps and live a life of crime.</p><p>He went on to become a teacher, mocked and ridiculed by pupils when he failed to keep control of his rowdy class and was forced to resign after he sexually assaulted female and male students.</p><h2>TASTE FOR BLOOD</h2><p>All this led to the murderer approaching his first victim, nine-year-old school girl Lena Zakontnova.</p><p>He lured the girl into an old home he had recently purchased and attempted to rape her.</p><p>When she struggled, he choked her before ejaculating as he stabbed her three times in the stomach - her body was later dumped in a nearby river.</p><p>Chikatilo was arrested but was later released when his wife provided an alibi to cover his crime - despite all evidence linking him to the crime.</p><p>Labourer Aleksandr Kravchenko was found guilty of the shocking murder and was sentenced to death in 1983.</p><p>The evil killer was able to continue his deadly crime spree after he described the 'thrill' of his first kill.</p><p>In 1981 Chikatilo murdered his second victim, Larisa Tkachenko, and in the following year, he slaughtered thirteen-year-old Lyuba Biryuk.</p><p>He mutilated Larisa's body with his teeth and bit off one of her nipples after beating her to death.</p><p>Lyuba was stabbed 22 times before her eyes were gouged out and 10-year-old Olga Stalmatsjenok was disemboweled at the hands of her killer.</p><p>Chikatilo's killings became more frequent and increasingly more violent.</p><p>He would target vulnerable or homeless young women and children, stalking bus and train stations - often luring them into nearby woods.</p><p>By 1983, the cannibal had killed at least 20 and managed to escape justice when cops failed to link him to the crime scene with DNA evidence - despite having his name on file.</p><p>By 1984 he was arrested and placed under house arrest in September of that year after killing at least 30 people.</p><p>Moscow's finest detectives were assembled to identify the 'sex-crazed' killer and cops began patrolling trains and bus stations.</p><p>In September of 1984, he was arrested when two undercover officers arrested the father-of-two talking to a young woman at a bus stop in his hometown of Rostov.</p><p>Police learned of his twisted sexual preferences for children and were shocked by the chilling contents of his briefcase - a knife, rope and vaseline.</p><p>But cops failed to link him to any murders after a DNA blunder and he served just three months for minor offenses.</p><p>He went on to kill another 20 people - although the true number of his victims is unknown it is thought it eventually killed at least 56 victims.</p><p>Often the bodies were found with the sexual organ removed, which he is thought to have eaten after they were mutilated by the sick maniac.</p><p>He would eventually be snared in 1990 when he was caught again by undercover cops as he approached young boys on the street holding his 'serial killer' briefcase.</p><p>He was arrested on November 20 and remained silent for just over a week before confessing the terrifying murders.</p><p>The killer burst into tears initially admitting to 36 murders where he would mount the dead body to achieve orgasm - he later confessed to a further 20 killings.</p><p>Sick Chikatilo faced trial in April 1992 and was charged with 53 counts of murder, five charges of sexual assault against minors - the first major media event after the fall of the Soviet Union.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><p>He appeared in an iron cage and was found guilty of 52 counts of murder and was sentenced to death.</p><p>In 1994 he was executed by a firing squad that shot a single bullet behind his right ear.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/NINTCHDBPICT000734399679.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/9b2671c2-3da3-4b6f-bf7e-f48a91e4a347.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZoV3f5JqaGxnk5a7r7XBmqNmo5mhuaa%2BjKucnWWinr2xsdFmqp6wXau2pMDIpqpmm5%2BnvbSx0mg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bobbie-houston.html>&#171;&nbsp;Bobbie Houston</a>
