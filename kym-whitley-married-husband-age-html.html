And the reason why he wanted to be Joshua’s father is that he didn’t have a father in his life.</p><p>As she’s got a son now, she doesn’t want to tread on thin ice with short relationships because if her son came to like the person, she’s dating, and they broke up, it would be hard to explain the separation.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>So, it's going to take some time before Kym finds her destined one and introduces him to her son as his father and Kym's future husband. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6DGrnnWoaCtpJWueq6t0augnpxdncK0rsCnm2aZl5p7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./robbie-maddison.html>&#171;&nbsp;Robbie Maddison</a>
