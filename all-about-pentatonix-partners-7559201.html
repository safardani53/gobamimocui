Welcome to the family, sweet Evie baby.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In March 2023, Maldonado revealed that she and Hausdorff got engaged in Japan. “well now japan is forever cemented as the best place in the whole wide world!” <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>she wrote on Instagram</a> to announce the news. “will miss you all SO much! thank you for beautiful, heartfelt shows. can’t believe i got engaged in tokyo!!! minna saiko! munega candode ippai desu! @hausdo … aishiteru!

"We're in different places all the time which makes those memories stronger in a way," she shared. "Her first train was in Japan, the bullet train, and first crawls in Fiji. It feels like she is the most well-traveled baby at this age — maybe ever."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added that her fellow Pentatonix members and fiancé Hausdorff, who is also the videographer on tour, had been super supportive about bringing her baby girl on the road.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I feel like Kevin gives her love because he's a dad, so he's always engaging her.

For the romantic ceremony, they were joined by their closest family and friends, including Sallee’s group mates.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We both knew pretty much after our first date that the connection was rare and special," <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the couple told PEOPLE</a> about their instant bond. "We'd both separately been praying for our life partners and knew that this wasn't a coincidence, and our walk on the moonlit beach that night solidified it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since becoming husband and wife, the couple has given many glimpses of their sweet relationship, including cheering each other on in their personal endeavors.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In May 2023, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sallee penned a sweet tribute</a> to his wife as she graduated from law school, calling himself “One Lucky Husband.” Meanwhile, Bishop has been by Sallee’s side for many Pentatonix events, including the 2023 Grammy Awards and the group’s Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-scott-hoying></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Scott Hoying</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amy Sussman/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Scott Hoying is married to Mark Manio. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>The couple first met in Los Angeles</a> in 2017 at a friend's birthday party where it was love at first sight for Hoying. "We talked the whole night and really hit it off," he recalled to PEOPLE. "We started hanging every single day, and I remember being blown away at how warm, wholesome and sweet Mark was. It was such a refreshing energy that I couldn’t get enough of. People always say that six years later, we still haven’t lost our 'honeymoon phase,' and we couldn't agree more."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Hoying later popped the question in the Bahamas</a> in April 2022, with the singer telling PEOPLE it was the “most nerve-wracking thing that I've ever done in my life ... Even though Mark and I had talked about [the engagement] a million times, I still put the pressure on myself to make it perfect."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>came to planning their wedding</a>, Hoying told PEOPLE he actually enlisted help from his group mates. “I keep asking Kevin and Matt for advice because they both had perfect, iconic weddings. They're like, ‘Yep, so many decisions to be made.’ But it's going well,” he said in May 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“All of my fiancé Mark's 100 Filipino family [members] are going to be there and then all my 150 of my friends throughout my whole life, and then my bandmates," he added of the guest list. "It's going to be a really special moment where everyone I love the most is in one place to celebrate the biggest day of Mark and my life. I'm just so excited.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The couple eventually tied the knot in July 2023 during a seaside ceremony in Santa Barbara, California. For their first dance, the couple asked Loren Allred to perform "Never Enough" from The Greatest Showman. Hoying also surprised Manio with a performance of his new song "Four," which the singer wrote for the model after their engagement.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The song is one of my favorite songs I have ever written, as it is a love letter I dedicated to Mark after we had dated for four years, and I can barely sing it without crying," he told PEOPLE.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to having his Pentatonix group mates in attendance, the wedding also included Colton Haynes, Adam Rippon, Brittany Broski, Randy Jackson and Betty Who.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mitch-grassi></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mitch Grassi</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Gabe Ginsberg/Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Mitch Grassi keeps his dating life fairly private and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>his social media posts</a> are predominantly about his music.
