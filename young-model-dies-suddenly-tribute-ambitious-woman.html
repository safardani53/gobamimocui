devastated family and friends have been left shocked by her death, and paid tribute to the “strong willed and ambitious” model.</p><p>Amy, who used the name Chloe Love in her work, had previously been employed by Babestation.</p><p>Friends believe that the model was struggling with “anxiety and depression” before her death.</p><p><a href=#>A fundraising page</a> explained: "A few days ago Amy took her own life. Her heart and mind were in pain and this life became too much for her. Some hearts are just too gentle for this world.”</p><p>Paying tribute to her daughter, her mum Karina said: "Amy was a smart, ambitious, witty young woman with a gentle heart and a lovely laugh.</p><p>"At 24 Amy had experienced more than most at her age.
